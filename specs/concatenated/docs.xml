    "html": "API Reference\nDirectives\nuse cache\nCopy page\nuse cache\n\nThe use cache directive allows you to mark a route, React component, or a function as cacheable. It can be used at the top of a file to indicate that all exports in the file should be cached, or inline at the top of function or component to cache the return value.\n\nGood to know: For caching user-specific content that requires access to cookies or headers, see 'use cache: private'.\n\nUsage\n\nuse cache is a Cache Components feature. To enable it, add the cacheComponents option to your next.config.ts file:\n\nnext.config.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  cacheComponents: true,\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nThen, add use cache at the file, component, or function level:\n\n// File level\n'use cache'\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  // ...\n}\n \n// Component level\nexport async function MyComponent() {\n  'use cache'\n  return <></>\n}\n \n// Function level\nexport async function getData() {\n  'use cache'\n  const data = await fetch('/api/data')\n  return data\n}\nHow use cache works\nCache keys\n\nA cache entry's key is generated using a serialized version of its inputs, which includes:\n\nBuild ID (generated for each build)\nFunction ID (a secure identifier unique to the function)\nThe serializable\n function arguments (or props).\n\nThe arguments passed to the cached function, as well as any values it reads from the parent scope automatically become a part of the key. This means, the same cache entry will be reused as long as its inputs are the same.\n\nNon-serializable arguments\n\nAny non-serializable arguments, props, or closed-over values will turn into references inside the cached function, and can be only passed through and not inspected nor modified. These non-serializable values will be filled in at the request time and won't become a part of the cache key.\n\nFor example, a cached function can take in JSX as a children prop and return <div>{children}</div>, but it won't be able to introspect the actual children object. This allows you to nest uncached content inside a cached component.\n\napp/ui/cached-component.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nfunction CachedComponent({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {\n  'use cache'\n  return <div>{children}</div>\n}\nReturn values\n\nThe return value of the cacheable function must be serializable. This ensures that the cached data can be stored and retrieved correctly.\n\nuse cache at build time\n\nWhen used at the top of a layout or page, the route segment will be prerendered, allowing it to later be revalidated.\n\nThis means use cache cannot be used with runtime data like cookies or headers.\n\nNote: If you need to cache content that depends on cookies, headers, or search params, use 'use cache: private' instead.\n\nuse cache at runtime\n\nOn the server, the cache entries of individual components or functions will be cached in-memory.\n\nThen, on the client, any content returned from the server cache will be stored in the browser's memory for the duration of the session or until revalidated.\n\nDuring revalidation\n\nBy default, use cache has server-side revalidation period of 15 minutes. While this period may be useful for content that doesn't require frequent updates, you can use the cacheLife and cacheTag APIs to configure when the individual cache entries should be revalidated.\n\ncacheLife: Configure the cache entry lifetime.\ncacheTag: Create tags for on-demand revalidation.\n\nBoth of these APIs integrate across the client and server caching layers, meaning you can configure your caching semantics in one place and have them apply everywhere.\n\nSee the cacheLife and cacheTag API docs for more information.\n\nExamples\nCaching an entire route with use cache\n\nTo prerender an entire route, add use cache to the top of both the layout and page files. Each of these segments are treated as separate entry points in your application, and will be cached independently.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use cache'\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {\n  return <div>{children}</div>\n}\n\nAny components imported and nested in page file are part of the cache output associated with the page.\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use cache'\n \nasync function Users() {\n  const users = await fetch('/api/users')\n  // loop through users\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <Users />\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nIf use cache is added only to the layout or the page, only that route segment and any components imported into it will be cached.\nIf any of the nested children in the route use Dynamic APIs, then the route will opt out of pre-rendering.\nCaching a component's output with use cache\n\nYou can use use cache at the component level to cache any fetches or computations performed within that component. The cache entry will be reused as long as the serialized props produce the same value in each instance.\n\napp/components/bookings.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport async function Bookings({ type = 'haircut' }: BookingsProps) {\n  'use cache'\n  async function getBookingsData() {\n    const data = await fetch(`/api/bookings?type=${encodeURIComponent(type)}`)\n    return data\n  }\n  return //...\n}\n \ninterface BookingsProps {\n  type: string\n}\nCaching function output with use cache\n\nSince you can add use cache to any asynchronous function, you aren't limited to caching components or routes only. You might want to cache a network request, a database query, or a slow computation.\n\napp/actions.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport async function getData() {\n  'use cache'\n \n  const data = await fetch('/api/data')\n  return data\n}\nInterleaving\n\nIn React, composition with children or slots is a well-known pattern for building flexible components. When using use cache, you can continue to compose your UI in this way. Anything included as children, or other compositional slots, in the returned JSX will be passed through the cached component without affecting its cache entry.\n\nAs long as you don't directly reference any of the JSX slots inside the body of the cacheable function itself, their presence in the returned output won't affect the cache entry.\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const uncachedData = await getData()\n  return (\n    // Pass compositional slots as props, e.g. header and children\n    <CacheComponent header={<h1>Home</h1>}>\n      {/* DynamicComponent is provided as the children slot */}\n      <DynamicComponent data={uncachedData} />\n    </CacheComponent>\n  )\n}\n \nasync function CacheComponent({\n  header, // header: a compositional slot, injected as a prop\n  children, // children: another slot for nested composition\n}: {\n  header: ReactNode\n  children: ReactNode\n}) {\n  'use cache'\n  const cachedData = await fetch('/api/cached-data')\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {header}\n      <PrerenderedComponent data={cachedData} />\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nYou can also pass Server Actions through cached components to Client Components without invoking them inside the cacheable function.\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport ClientComponent from './ClientComponent'\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  const performUpdate = async () => {\n    'use server'\n    // Perform some server-side update\n    await db.update(...)\n  }\n \n  return <CacheComponent performUpdate={performUpdate} />\n}\n \nasync function CachedComponent({\n  performUpdate,\n}: {\n  performUpdate: () => Promise<void>\n}) {\n  'use cache'\n  // Do not call performUpdate here\n  return <ClientComponent action={performUpdate} />\n}\napp/ClientComponent.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nexport default function ClientComponent({\n  action,\n}: {\n  action: () => Promise<void>\n}) {\n  return <button onClick={action}>Update</button>\n}\nPlatform Support\nDeployment Option\tSupported\nNode.js server\tYes\nDocker container\tYes\nStatic export\tNo\nAdapters\tPlatform-specific\n\nLearn how to configure caching when self-hosting Next.js.\n\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv16.0.0\t\"use cache\" is enabled with the Cache Components feature.\nv15.0.0\t\"use cache\" is introduced as an experimental feature.\nRelated\nView related API references.\nuse cache: private\nLearn how to use the `\"use cache: private\"` directive to enable runtime prefetching of personalized content in your Next.js application.\ncacheComponents\nLearn how to enable the cacheComponents flag in Next.js.\ncacheLife\nLearn how to set up cacheLife configurations in Next.js.\ncacheTag\nLearn how to use the cacheTag function to manage cache invalidation in your Next.js application.\ncacheLife\nLearn how to use the cacheLife function to set the cache expiration time for a cached function or component.\nrevalidateTag\nAPI Reference for the revalidateTag function.\nPrevious\nDirectives\nNext\nuse cache: private\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

Values below 30 seconds are treated as dynamic.\n\nDifference from use cache\n\nWhile regular use cache is designed for static, shared content that can be cached on the server, 'use cache: private' is specifically for dynamic, user-specific content that needs to be:\n\nPersonalized - varies based on cookies, headers, or search params\nPrefetchable - can be loaded before the user navigates to the page\nClient-only - never persisted to server-side cache handlers\nFeature\tuse cache\t'use cache: private'\nAccess to await cookies()\tNo\tYes\nAccess to await headers()\tNo\tYes\nAccess to await searchParams\tNo\tYes\nStored in cache handler\tYes (server-side)\tNo (client-side only)\nRuntime prefetchable\tN/A (already static)\tYes (when configured)\nCache scope\tGlobal (shared)\tPer-user (isolated)\nUse case\tStatic, shared content\tPersonalized, user-specific content\nHow it works\nRuntime prefetching\n\nWhen a user hovers over or views a link to a page with unstable_prefetch = { mode: 'runtime' }:\n\nStatic content is prefetched immediately (layouts, page shell)\nPrivate cache functions are executed with the user's current cookies/headers\nResults are stored in the client-side Resume Data Cache\nNavigation is instant - both static and personalized content are already loaded\n\nGood to know: Without 'use cache: private', personalized content cannot be prefetched and must wait until after navigation completes. Runtime prefetching eliminates this delay by executing cache functions with the user's current request context.\n\nStorage behavior\n\nPrivate caches are never persisted to server-side cache handlers (like Redis, Vercel Data Cache, etc.). They exist only to:\n\nEnable runtime prefetching of personalized content\nStore prefetched data in the client-side cache during the session\nCoordinate cache invalidation with tags and stale times\n\nThis ensures user-specific data is never accidentally shared between users while still enabling fast, prefetched navigation.\n\nStale time requirements\n\nNote: Functions with a cacheLife stale time less than 30 seconds will not be runtime prefetched, even when using 'use cache: private'. This prevents prefetching of rapidly changing data that would likely be stale by navigation time.\n\n// Will be runtime prefetched (stale ≥ 30s)\ncacheLife({ stale: 60 })\n \n// Will be runtime prefetched (stale ≥ 30s)\ncacheLife({ stale: 30 })\n \n// Will NOT be runtime prefetched (stale < 30s)\ncacheLife({ stale: 10 })\nRequest APIs allowed in private caches\n\nThe following request-specific APIs can be used inside 'use cache: private' functions:\n\nAPI\tAllowed in use cache\tAllowed in 'use cache: private'\ncookies()\tNo\tYes\nheaders()\tNo\tYes\nsearchParams\tNo\tYes\nconnection()\tNo\tNo\n\nNote: The connection()\n API is prohibited in both use cache and 'use cache: private' as it provides connection-specific information that cannot be safely cached.\n\nNesting rules\n\nPrivate caches have specific nesting rules to prevent user-specific data from leaking into shared caches:\n\nPrivate caches can be nested inside other private caches\nPrivate caches cannot be nested inside public caches ('use cache', 'use cache: remote')\nPublic caches can be nested inside private caches\n// VALID: Private inside private\nasync function outerPrivate() {\n  'use cache: private'\n  const result = await innerPrivate()\n  return result\n}\n \nasync function innerPrivate() {\n  'use cache: private'\n  return getData()\n}\n \n// INVALID: Private inside public\nasync function outerPublic() {\n  'use cache'\n  const result = await innerPrivate() // Error!\n  return result\n}\n \nasync function innerPrivate() {\n  'use cache: private'\n  return getData()\n}\nExamples\nPersonalized product recommendations\n\nThis example shows how to cache personalized product recommendations based on a user's session cookie. The recommendations are prefetched at runtime when the user hovers over product links.\n\napp/product/[id]/page.tsx\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\nimport { cacheLife, cacheTag } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport const unstable_prefetch = {\n  mode: 'runtime',\n  samples: [\n    { params: { id: '1' }, cookies: [{ name: 'user-id', value: 'user-123' }] },\n  ],\n}\n \nasync function getRecommendations(productId: string) {\n  'use cache: private'\n  cacheTag(`recommendations-${productId}`)\n  cacheLife({ stale: 60 })\n \n  const userId = (await cookies()).get('user-id')?.value\n \n  // Fetch personalized recommendations based on user's browsing history\n  const recommendations = await db.recommendations.findMany({\n    where: { userId, productId },\n  })\n \n  return recommendations\n}\nUser-specific pricing\n\nCache pricing information that varies by user tier, allowing instant navigation to the pricing page with personalized rates already loaded.\n\napp/pricing/page.tsx\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\nimport { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport const unstable_prefetch = {\n  mode: 'runtime',\n  samples: [{ cookies: [{ name: 'user-tier', value: 'premium' }] }],\n}\n \nasync function getPricing() {\n  'use cache: private'\n  cacheLife({ stale: 300 }) // 5 minutes\n \n  const tier = (await cookies()).get('user-tier')?.value || 'free'\n \n  // Return tier-specific pricing\n  return db.pricing.findMany({ where: { tier } })\n}\nLocalized content based on headers\n\nServe localized content based on the user's Accept-Language header, prefetching the correct language variant before navigation.\n\napp/page.tsx\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers'\nimport { cacheLife, cacheTag } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport const unstable_prefetch = {\n  mode: 'runtime',\n  samples: [{ headers: [{ name: 'accept-language', value: 'en-US' }] }],\n}\n \nasync function getLocalizedContent() {\n  'use cache: private'\n  cacheTag('content')\n  cacheLife({ stale: 3600 }) // 1 hour\n \n  const headersList = await headers()\n  const locale = headersList.get('accept-language')?.split(',')[0] || 'en-US'\n \n  return db.content.findMany({ where: { locale } })\n}\nSearch results with user preferences\n\nPrefetch search results that include user-specific preferences, ensuring personalized search results load instantly.\n\napp/search/page.tsx\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\nimport { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport const unstable_prefetch = {\n  mode: 'runtime',\n  samples: [\n    {\n      searchParams: { q: 'laptop' },\n      cookies: [{ name: 'preferences', value: 'compact-view' }],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n \nasync function getSearchResults(query: string) {\n  'use cache: private'\n  cacheLife({ stale: 120 }) // 2 minutes\n \n  const preferences = (await cookies()).get('preferences')?.value\n \n  // Apply user preferences to search results\n  return searchWithPreferences(query, preferences)\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nPrivate caches are ephemeral and only exist in the client-side cache for the session duration\nPrivate cache results are never written to server-side cache handlers\nThe unstable_prefetch export is required for runtime prefetching to work\nA minimum stale time of 30 seconds is required for private caches to be prefetched\nYou can use cacheTag() and revalidateTag() to invalidate private caches\nEach user gets their own private cache entries based on their cookies/headers\nPlatform Support\nDeployment Option\tSupported\nNode.js server\tYes\nDocker container\tYes\nStatic export\tNo\nAdapters\tYes\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv16.0.0\t'use cache: private' introduced as an experimental feature.\nRelated\nView related API references.\nuse cache\nLearn how to use the use cache directive to cache data in your Next.js application.\ncacheComponents\nLearn how to enable the cacheComponents flag in Next.js.\ncacheLife\nLearn how to use the cacheLife function to set the cache expiration time for a cached function or component.\ncacheTag\nLearn how to use the cacheTag function to manage cache invalidation in your Next.js application.\nPrefetching\nLearn how to configure prefetching in Next.js\nPrevious\nuse cache\nNext\nuse cache: remote\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

    "html": "API Reference\nDirectives\nuse client\nCopy page\nuse client\n\nThe 'use client' directive declares an entry point for the components to be rendered on the client side and should be used when creating interactive user interfaces (UI) that require client-side JavaScript capabilities, such as state management, event handling, and access to browser APIs. This is a React feature.\n\nGood to know:\n\nYou do not need to add the 'use client' directive to every file that contains Client Components. You only need to add it to the files whose components you want to render directly within Server Components. The 'use client' directive defines the client-server boundary\n, and the components exported from such a file serve as entry points to the client.\n\nUsage\n\nTo declare an entry point for the Client Components, add the 'use client' directive at the top of the file, before any imports:\n\napp/components/counter.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { useState } from 'react'\n \nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nWhen using the 'use client' directive, the props of the Client Components must be serializable\n. This means the props need to be in a format that React can serialize when sending data from the server to the client.\n\napp/components/counter.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nexport default function Counter({\n  onClick /* ❌ Function is not serializable */,\n}) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={onClick}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nNesting Client Components within Server Components\n\nCombining Server and Client Components allows you to build applications that are both performant and interactive:\n\nServer Components: Use for static content, data fetching, and SEO-friendly elements.\nClient Components: Use for interactive elements that require state, effects, or browser APIs.\nComponent composition: Nest Client Components within Server Components as needed for a clear separation of server and client logic.\n\nIn the following example:\n\nHeader is a Server Component handling static content.\nCounter is a Client Component enabling interactivity within the page.\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Header from './header'\nimport Counter from './counter' // This is a Client Component\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Header />\n      <Counter />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nReference\n\nSee the React documentation\n for more information on 'use client'.\n\nPrevious\nuse cache: remote\nNext\nuse server\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

Note that this is not recommended as it will dramatically increase the cache size and reduce the cache hit rate.\n\nWhen to use each directive\n\nChoose the right caching directive based on your use case:\n\nUse use cache when:\n\nContent can be prerendered at build time\nContent is shared across all users\nContent doesn't depend on request-specific data\n\nUse 'use cache: remote' when:\n\nYou need caching within dynamic context\nContent is shared across users but must be rendered per-request (after await connection())\nYou want to cache expensive operations in a server-side cache handler\n\nUse 'use cache: private' when:\n\nContent is personalized per-user (depends on cookies, headers)\nYou need runtime prefetching of user-specific content\nContent should never be shared between users\nHow it works\n\nThe 'use cache: remote' directive enables runtime caching of shared data in dynamic contexts by storing results in server-side cache handlers rather than prerendering at build time.\n\nDynamic context detection\n\nWhen Next.js encounters certain APIs like connection(), cookies(), or headers(), the context becomes \"dynamic\". In a dynamic context:\n\nRegular use cache stops working - it won't cache anything\n'use cache: remote' continues to work - it is cached by a remote cache handler.\nResults are stored server-side in a key-value store configured for your deployment\nCached data is shared across requests - reducing database load and origin requests\n\nGood to know: Without 'use cache: remote', functions in dynamic contexts would execute on every request, potentially creating performance bottlenecks. Remote caching eliminates this issue by storing results in server-side cache handlers.\n\nStorage behavior\n\nRemote caches are persisted using server-side cache handlers, which may include:\n\nDistributed key-value stores (in-memory or persistent storage solutions)\nFile system or in-memory storage (often used in development or for custom deployments)\nEnvironment-specific caches (provided by your hosting infrastructure)\nCustom or configured cache handlers (depending on your application's setup)\n\nThis means:\n\nCached data is shared across all users and requests\nCache entries persist beyond a single session\nCache invalidation works via cacheTag and revalidateTag\nCache expiration is controlled by cacheLife configuration\nDynamic context example\nasync function UserDashboard() {\n  // Calling connection() makes the context dynamic\n  await connection()\n \n  // Without any caching directive, this runs on every request\n  const stats = await getStats()\n \n  // With 'use cache: remote', this is cached in the remote handler\n  const analytics = await getAnalytics()\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Stats data={stats} />\n      <Analytics data={analytics} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nasync function getAnalytics() {\n  'use cache: remote'\n  cacheLife({ expire: 300 }) // 5 minutes\n \n  // This expensive operation is cached and shared across all requests\n  return fetchAnalyticsData()\n}\nRequest APIs and remote caches\n\nWhile 'use cache: remote' technically allows access to request-specific data by calling API's like cookies() and headers() before calling a function that is wrapped by 'use cache: remote', it's generally not recommended to use them together:\n\nAPI\tAllowed in use cache\tAllowed in 'use cache: remote'\tRecommended\ncookies()\tNo\tNo\tUse 'use cache: private' instead\nheaders()\tNo\tNo\tUse 'use cache: private' instead\nconnection()\tNo\tNo\tNo - these cannot ever be cached\nsearchParams\tNo\tNo\tUse 'use cache: private' instead\n\nImportant: If you need to cache based on cookies, headers, or search params, use 'use cache: private' instead. Remote caches are shared across all users, so caching user-specific data in them can lead to incorrect results being served to different users.\n\nNesting rules\n\nRemote caches have specific nesting rules:\n\nRemote caches can be nested inside other remote caches ('use cache: remote')\nRemote caches can be nested inside regular caches ('use cache')\nRemote caches cannot be nested inside private caches ('use cache: private')\nPrivate caches cannot be nested inside remote caches\n// VALID: Remote inside remote\nasync function outerRemote() {\n  'use cache: remote'\n  const result = await innerRemote()\n  return result\n}\n \nasync function innerRemote() {\n  'use cache: remote'\n  return getData()\n}\n \n// VALID: Remote inside regular cache\nasync function outerCache() {\n  'use cache'\n  // If this is in a dynamic context, the inner remote cache will work\n  const result = await innerRemote()\n  return result\n}\n \nasync function innerRemote() {\n  'use cache: remote'\n  return getData()\n}\n \n// INVALID: Remote inside private\nasync function outerPrivate() {\n  'use cache: private'\n  const result = await innerRemote() // Error!\n  return result\n}\n \nasync function innerRemote() {\n  'use cache: remote'\n  return getData()\n}\n \n// INVALID: Private inside remote\nasync function outerRemote() {\n  'use cache: remote'\n  const result = await innerPrivate() // Error!\n  return result\n}\n \nasync function innerPrivate() {\n  'use cache: private'\n  return getData()\n}\nExamples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate common patterns for using 'use cache: remote'. For details about cacheLife parameters (stale, revalidate, expire), see the cacheLife API reference.\n\nPer-request database queries\n\nCache expensive database queries that are accessed in dynamic contexts, reducing load on your database:\n\napp/dashboard/page.tsx\nimport { connection } from 'next/server'\nimport { cacheLife, cacheTag } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport default async function DashboardPage() {\n  // Make context dynamic\n  await connection()\n \n  const stats = await getGlobalStats()\n \n  return <StatsDisplay stats={stats} />\n}\n \nasync function getGlobalStats() {\n  'use cache: remote'\n  cacheTag('global-stats')\n  cacheLife({ expire: 60 }) // 1 minute\n \n  // This expensive database query is cached and shared across all users,\n  // reducing load on your database\n  const stats = await db.analytics.aggregate({\n    total_users: 'count',\n    active_sessions: 'count',\n    revenue: 'sum',\n  })\n \n  return stats\n}\nAPI responses in streaming contexts\n\nCache API responses that are fetched during streaming or after dynamic operations:\n\napp/feed/page.tsx\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport { connection } from 'next/server'\nimport { cacheLife, cacheTag } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport default async function FeedPage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>\n        <FeedItems />\n      </Suspense>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nasync function FeedItems() {\n  // Dynamic context\n  await connection()\n \n  const items = await getFeedItems()\n \n  return items.map((item) => <FeedItem key={item.id} item={item} />)\n}\n \nasync function getFeedItems() {\n  'use cache: remote'\n  cacheTag('feed-items')\n  cacheLife({ expire: 120 }) // 2 minutes\n \n  // This API call is cached, reducing requests to your external service\n  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/feed')\n  return response.json()\n}\nComputed data after dynamic checks\n\nCache expensive computations that occur after dynamic security or feature checks:\n\napp/reports/page.tsx\nimport { connection } from 'next/server'\nimport { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport default async function ReportsPage() {\n  // Dynamic security check\n  await connection()\n \n  const report = await generateReport()\n \n  return <ReportViewer report={report} />\n}\n \nasync function generateReport() {\n  'use cache: remote'\n  cacheLife({ expire: 3600 }) // 1 hour\n \n  // This expensive computation is cached and shared across all authorized users,\n  // avoiding repeated calculations\n  const data = await db.transactions.findMany()\n \n  return {\n    totalRevenue: calculateRevenue(data),\n    topProducts: analyzeProducts(data),\n    trends: calculateTrends(data),\n  }\n}\nMixed caching strategies\n\nCombine static, remote, and private caching for optimal performance:\n\napp/product/[id]/page.tsx\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport { connection } from 'next/server'\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\nimport { cacheLife, cacheTag } from 'next/cache'\n \n// Static product data -

    "html": "API Reference\nDirectives\nuse server\nCopy page\nuse server\n\nThe use server directive designates a function or file to be executed on the server side. It can be used at the top of a file to indicate that all functions in the file are server-side, or inline at the top of a function to mark the function as a Server Function\n. This is a React feature.\n\nUsing use server at the top of a file\n\nThe following example shows a file with a use server directive at the top. All functions in the file are executed on the server.\n\napp/actions.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use server'\nimport { db } from '@/lib/db' // Your database client\n \nexport async function createUser(data: { name: string; email: string }) {\n  const user = await db.user.create({ data })\n  return user\n}\nUsing Server Functions in a Client Component\n\nTo use Server Functions in Client Components you need to create your Server Functions in a dedicated file using the use server directive at the top of the file. These Server Functions can then be imported into Client and Server Components and executed.\n\nAssuming you have a fetchUsers Server Function in actions.ts:\n\napp/actions.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use server'\nimport { db } from '@/lib/db' // Your database client\n \nexport async function fetchUsers() {\n  const users = await db.user.findMany()\n  return users\n}\n\nThen you can import the fetchUsers Server Function into a Client Component and execute it on the client-side.\n\napp/components/my-button.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\nimport { fetchUsers } from '../actions'\n \nexport default function MyButton() {\n  return <button onClick={() => fetchUsers()}>Fetch Users</button>\n}\nUsing use server inline\n\nIn the following example, use server is used inline at the top of a function to mark it as a Server Function\n:\n\napp/posts/[id]/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { EditPost } from './edit-post'\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params.id)\n \n  async function updatePost(formData: FormData) {\n    'use server'\n    await savePost(params.id, formData)\n    revalidatePath(`/posts/${params.id}`)\n  }\n \n  return <EditPost updatePostAction={updatePost} post={post} />\n}\nSecurity considerations\n\nWhen using the use server directive, it's important to ensure that all server-side logic is secure and that sensitive data remains protected.\n\nAuthentication and authorization\n\nAlways authenticate and authorize users before performing sensitive server-side operations.\n\napp/actions.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use server'\n \nimport { db } from '@/lib/db' // Your database client\nimport { authenticate } from '@/lib/auth' // Your authentication library\n \nexport async function createUser(\n  data: { name: string; email: string },\n  token: string\n) {\n  const user = authenticate(token)\n  if (!user) {\n    throw new Error('Unauthorized')\n  }\n  const newUser = await db.user.create({ data })\n  return newUser\n}\nReference\n\nSee the React documentation\n for more information on use server.\n\nPrevious\nuse client\nNext\nComponents\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

    "html": "API Reference\nComponents\nForm Component\nCopy page\nForm Component\n\nThe <Form> component extends the HTML <form> element to provide prefetching of loading UI, client-side navigation on submission, and progressive enhancement.\n\nIt's useful for forms that update URL search params as it reduces the boilerplate code needed to achieve the above.\n\nBasic usage:\n\n/app/ui/search.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Form from 'next/form'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Form action=\"/search\">\n      {/* On submission, the input value will be appended to\n          the URL, e.g. /search?query=abc */}\n      <input name=\"query\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n    </Form>\n  )\n}\nReference\n\nThe behavior of the <Form> component depends on whether the action prop is passed a string or function.\n\nWhen action is a string, the <Form> behaves like a native HTML form that uses a GET method. The form data is encoded into the URL as search params, and when the form is submitted, it navigates to the specified URL. In addition, Next.js:\nPrefetches the path when the form becomes visible, this preloads shared UI (e.g. layout.js and loading.js), resulting in faster navigation.\nPerforms a client-side navigation instead of a full page reload when the form is submitted. This retains shared UI and client-side state.\nWhen action is a function (Server Action), <Form> behaves like a React form\n, executing the action when the form is submitted.\naction (string) Props\n\nWhen action is a string, the <Form> component supports the following props:\n\nProp\tExample\tType\tRequired\naction\taction=\"/search\"\tstring (URL or relative path)\tYes\nreplace\treplace={false}\tboolean\t-\nscroll\tscroll={true}\tboolean\t-\nprefetch\tprefetch={true}\tboolean\t-\naction: The URL or path to navigate to when the form is submitted.\nAn empty string \"\" will navigate to the same route with updated search params.\nreplace: Replaces the current history state instead of pushing a new one to the browser's history\n stack. Default is false.\nscroll: Controls the scroll behavior during navigation. Defaults to true, this means it will scroll to the top of the new route, and maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation.\nprefetch: Controls whether the path should be prefetched when the form becomes visible in the user's viewport. Defaults to true.\naction (function) Props\n\nWhen action is a function, the <Form> component supports the following prop:\n\nProp\tExample\tType\tRequired\naction\taction={myAction}\tfunction (Server Action)\tYes\naction: The Server Action to be called when the form is submitted. See the React docs\n for more.\n\nGood to know: When action is a function, the replace and scroll props are ignored.\n\nCaveats\nformAction: Can be used in a <button> or <input type=\"submit\"> fields to override the action prop. Next.js will perform a client-side navigation, however, this approach doesn't support prefetching.\nWhen using basePath, you must also include it in the formAction path. e.g. formAction=\"/base-path/search\".\nkey: Passing a key prop to a string action is not supported. If you'd like to trigger a re-render or perform a mutation, consider using a function action instead.\nonSubmit: Can be used to handle form submission logic. However, calling event.preventDefault() will override <Form> behavior such as navigating to the specified URL.\nmethod\n, encType\n, target\n: Are not supported as they override <Form> behavior.\nSimilarly, formMethod, formEncType, and formTarget can be used to override the method, encType, and target props respectively, and using them will fallback to native browser behavior.\nIf you need to use these props, use the HTML <form> element instead.\n<input type=\"file\">: Using this input type when the action is a string will match browser behavior by submitting the filename instead of the file object.\nExamples\nSearch form that leads to a search result page\n\nYou can create a search form that navigates to a search results page by passing the path as an action:\n\n/app/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Form from 'next/form'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Form action=\"/search\">\n      <input name=\"query\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n    </Form>\n  )\n}\n\nWhen the user updates the query input field and submits the form, the form data will be encoded into the URL as search params, e.g. /search?query=abc.\n\nGood to know: If you pass an empty string \"\" to action, the form will navigate to the same route with updated search params.\n\nOn the results page, you can access the query using the searchParams page.js prop and use it to fetch data from an external source.\n\n/app/search/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { getSearchResults } from '@/lib/search'\n \nexport default async function SearchPage({\n  searchParams,\n}: {\n  searchParams: Promise<{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }>\n}) {\n  const results = await getSearchResults((await searchParams).query)\n \n  return <div>...</div>\n}\n\nWhen the <Form> becomes visible in the user's viewport, shared UI (such as layout.js and loading.js) on the /search page will be prefetched. On submission, the form will immediately navigate to the new route and show loading UI while the results are being fetched. You can design the fallback UI using loading.js:\n\n/app/search/loading.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default function Loading() {\n  return <div>Loading...</div>\n}\n\nTo cover cases when shared UI hasn't yet loaded, you can show instant feedback to the user using useFormStatus\n.\n\nFirst, create a component that displays a loading state when the form is pending:\n\n/app/ui/search-button.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\nimport { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom'\n \nexport default function SearchButton() {\n  const status = useFormStatus()\n  return (\n    <button type=\"submit\">{status.pending ? 'Searching...' : 'Search'}</button>\n  )\n}\n\nThen, update the search form page to use the SearchButton component:\n\n/app/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Form from 'next/form'\nimport { SearchButton } from '@/ui/search-button'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Form action=\"/search\">\n      <input name=\"query\" />\n      <SearchButton />\n    </Form>\n  )\n}\nMutations with Server Actions\n\nYou can perform mutations by passing a function to the action prop.\n\n/app/posts/create/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Form from 'next/form'\nimport { createPost } from '@/posts/actions'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Form action={createPost}>\n      <input name=\"title\" />\n      {/* ... */}\n      <button type=\"submit\">Create Post</button>\n    </Form>\n  )\n}\n\nAfter a mutation, it's common to redirect to the new resource. You can use the redirect function from next/navigation to navigate to the new post page.\n\nGood to know: Since the \"destination\" of the form submission is not known until the action is executed, <Form> cannot automatically prefetch shared UI.\n\n/app/posts/actions.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use server'\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport async function createPost(formData: FormData) {\n  // Create a new post\n  // ...\n \n  // Redirect to the new post\n  redirect(`/posts/${data.id}`)\n}\n\nThen, in the new page, you can fetch data using the params prop:\n\n/app/posts/[id]/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { getPost } from '@/posts/data'\n \nexport default async function PostPage({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ id: string }>\n}) {\n  const { id } = await params\n  const data = await getPost(id)\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{data.title}</h1>\n      {/* ... */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nSee the Server Actions docs for more examples.\n\nPrevious\nFont\nNext\nImage Component\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

We recommend using variable fonts\n for the best performance and flexibility.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n \n// If loading a variable font, you don't need to specify the font weight\nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={inter.className}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nIf you can't use a variable font, you will need to specify a weight:\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { Roboto } from 'next/font/google'\n \nconst roboto = Roboto({\n  weight: '400',\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={roboto.className}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nYou can specify multiple weights and/or styles by using an array:\n\napp/layout.js\nconst roboto = Roboto({\n  weight: ['400', '700'],\n  style: ['normal', 'italic'],\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n\nGood to know: Use an underscore (_) for font names with multiple words. E.g. Roboto Mono should be imported as Roboto_Mono.\n\nSpecifying a subset\n\nGoogle Fonts are automatically subset\n. This reduces the size of the font file and improves performance. You'll need to define which of these subsets you want to preload. Failing to specify any subsets while preload is true will result in a warning.\n\nThis can be done by adding it to the function call:\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n\nView the Font API Reference for more information.\n\nUsing Multiple Fonts\n\nYou can import and use multiple fonts in your application. There are two approaches you can take.\n\nThe first approach is to create a utility function that exports a font, imports it, and applies its className where needed. This ensures the font is preloaded only when it's rendered:\n\napp/fonts.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\n \nexport const inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n \nexport const roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { inter } from './fonts'\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={inter.className}>\n      <body>\n        <div>{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { roboto_mono } from './fonts'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1 className={roboto_mono.className}>My page</h1>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nIn the example above, Inter will be applied globally, and Roboto Mono can be imported and applied as needed.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a CSS variable and use it with your preferred CSS solution:\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\nimport styles from './global.css'\n \nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n \nconst roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  variable: '--font-roboto-mono',\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={`${inter.variable} ${roboto_mono.variable}`}>\n      <body>\n        <h1>My App</h1>\n        <div>{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\napp/global.css\nhtml {\n  font-family: var(--font-inter);\n}\n \nh1 {\n  font-family: var(--font-roboto-mono);\n}\n\nIn the example above, Inter will be applied globally, and any <h1> tags will be styled with Roboto Mono.\n\nRecommendation: Use multiple fonts conservatively since each new font is an additional resource the client has to download.\n\nLocal Fonts\n\nImport next/font/local and specify the src of your local font file. We recommend using variable fonts\n for the best performance and flexibility.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport localFont from 'next/font/local'\n \n// Font files can be colocated inside of `app`\nconst myFont = localFont({\n  src: './my-font.woff2',\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={myFont.className}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nIf you want to use multiple files for a single font family, src can be an array:\n\nconst roboto = localFont({\n  src: [\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-Regular.woff2',\n      weight: '400',\n      style: 'normal',\n    },\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-Italic.woff2',\n      weight: '400',\n      style: 'italic',\n    },\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-Bold.woff2',\n      weight: '700',\n      style: 'normal',\n    },\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-BoldItalic.woff2',\n      weight: '700',\n      style: 'italic',\n    },\n  ],\n})\n\nView the Font API Reference for more information.\n\nWith Tailwind CSS\n\nnext/font integrates seamlessly with Tailwind CSS\n using CSS variables.\n\nIn the example below, we use the Inter and Roboto_Mono fonts from next/font/google (you can use any Google Font or Local Font). Use the variable option to define a CSS variable name, such as inter and roboto_mono for these fonts, respectively. Then, apply inter.variable and roboto_mono.variable to include the CSS variables in your HTML document.\n\nGood to know: You can add these variables to the <html> or <body> tag, depending on your preference, styling needs or project requirements.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\n \nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n})\n \nconst roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n  variable: '--font-roboto-mono',\n})\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html\n      lang=\"en\"\n      className={`${inter.variable} ${roboto_mono.variable} antialiased`}\n    >\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nFinally, add the CSS variable to your Tailwind CSS config:\n\nglobal.css\n@import 'tailwindcss';\n \n@theme inline {\n  --font-sans: var(--font-inter);\n  --font-mono: var(--font-roboto-mono);\n}\nTailwind CSS v3\ntailwind.config.js\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      fontFamily: {\n        sans: ['var(--font-inter)'],\n        mono: ['var(--font-roboto-mono)'],\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n}\n\nYou can now use the font-sans and font-mono utility classes to apply the font to your elements.\n\n<p class=\"font-sans ...\">The quick brown fox ...</p>\n<p class=\"font-mono ...\">The quick brown fox ...</p>\nApplying Styles\n\nYou can apply the font styles in three ways:\n\nclassName\nstyle\nCSS Variables\nclassName\n\nReturns a read-only CSS className for the loaded font to be passed to an HTML element.\n\n<p className={inter.className}>Hello, Next.js!</p>\nstyle\n\nReturns a read-only CSS style object for the loaded font to be passed to an HTML element, including style.fontFamily to access the font family name and fallback fonts.\n\n<p style={inter.style}>Hello World</p>\nCSS Variables\n\nIf you would like to set your styles in an external style sheet and specify additional options there, use the CSS variable method.\n\nIn addition to importing the font, also import the CSS file where the CSS variable is defined and set the variable option of the font loader object as follows:\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\nimport styles from '../styles/component.module.css'\n \nconst inter = Inter({\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n})\n\nTo use the font, set the className of the parent container of the text you would like to style to the font loader's variable value and the className of the text to the styles property from the external CSS file.\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n<main className={inter.variable}>\n  <p className={styles.text}>Hello World</p>\n</main>\n\nDefine the text selector class in the component.module.css CSS file as follows:\n\nstyles/component.module.css\n.text {\n  font-family: var(--font-inter);\n  font-weight: 200;\n  font-style: italic;\n}\n\nIn the example above, the text Hello World is styled using the Inter font and the generated font fallback with font-weight: 200 and font-style: italic.\n\nUsing a font definitions file\n\nEvery time you call the localFont or Google font function, that font will be hosted as one instance in your application. Therefore, if you need to use the same font in multiple places, you should load it in one place and import the related font object where you need it. This is done using a font definitions file.\n\nFor example, create a fonts.ts file in a styles folder at the root of your app directory.\n\nThen, specify your font definitions as follows:\n\nstyles/fonts.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { Inter, Lora, Source_Sans_3 } from 'next/font/google'\nimport localFont from 'next/font/local'\n \n// define your variable fonts\nconst inter = Inter()\nconst lora = Lora()\n// define 2 weights of a non-variable font\nconst sourceCodePro400 = Source_Sans_3({ weight: '400' })\nconst sourceCodePro700 = Source_Sans_3({ weight: '700' })\n// define a custom local font where GreatVibes-Regular.ttf is stored in the styles folder\nconst greatVibes = localFont({ src: './GreatVibes-Regular.ttf' })\n \nexport { inter, lora, sourceCodePro400, sourceCodePro700, greatVibes }\n\nYou can now use these definitions in your code as follows:\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { inter, lora, sourceCodePro700, greatVibes } from '../styles/fonts'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p className={inter.className}>Hello world using Inter font</p>\n      <p style={lora.style}>Hello world using Lora font</p>\n      <p className={sourceCodePro700.className}>\n        Hello world using Source_Sans_3 font with weight 700\n      </p>\n      <p className={greatVibes.className}>My title in Great Vibes font</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nTo make it easier to access the font definitions in your code, you can define a path alias in your tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json files as follows:\n\ntsconfig.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/fonts\": [\"./styles/fonts\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nYou can now import any font definition as follows:\n\napp/about/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { greatVibes, sourceCodePro400 } from '@/fonts'\nPreloading\n\nWhen a font function is called on a page of your site, it is not globally available and preloaded on all routes. Rather, the font is only preloaded on the related routes based on the type of file where it is used:\n\nIf it's a unique page, it is preloaded on the unique route for that page.\nIf it's a layout, it is preloaded on all the routes wrapped by the layout.\nIf it's the root layout, it is preloaded on all routes.\nVersion Changes\nVersion\tChanges\nv13.2.0\t@next/font renamed to next/font. Installation no longer required.\nv13.0.0\t@next/font was added.\nPrevious\nComponents\nNext\nForm Component\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

Can be one of the following:\n\nAn internal path string.\n\n<Image src=\"/profile.png\" />\n\nAn absolute external URL (must be configured with remotePatterns).\n\n<Image src=\"https://example.com/profile.png\" />\n\nA static import.\n\nimport profile from './profile.png'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Image src={profile} />\n}\n\nGood to know: For security reasons, the Image Optimization API using the default loader will not forward headers when fetching the src image. If the src image requires authentication, consider using the unoptimized property to disable Image Optimization.\n\nalt\n\nThe alt property is used to describe the image for screen readers and search engines. It is also the fallback text if images have been disabled or an error occurs while loading the image.\n\nIt should contain text that could replace the image without changing the meaning of the page\n. It is not meant to supplement the image and should not repeat information that is already provided in the captions above or below the image.\n\nIf the image is purely decorative\n or not intended for the user\n, the alt property should be an empty string (alt=\"\").\n\nLearn more about image accessibility guidelines\n.\n\nwidth and height\n\nThe width and height properties represent the intrinsic\n image size in pixels. This property is used to infer the correct aspect ratio used by browsers to reserve space for the image and avoid layout shift during loading. It does not determine the rendered size of the image, which is controlled by CSS.\n\n<Image src=\"/profile.png\" width={500} height={500} />\n\nYou must set both width and height properties unless:\n\nThe image is statically imported.\nThe image has the fill property\n\nIf the height and width are unknown, we recommend using the fill property.\n\nfill\n\nA boolean that causes the image to expand to the size of the parent element.\n\n<Image src=\"/profile.png\" fill={true} />\n\nPositioning:\n\nThe parent element must assign position: \"relative\", \"fixed\", \"absolute\".\nBy default, the <img> element uses position: \"absolute\".\n\nObject Fit:\n\nIf no styles are applied to the image, the image will stretch to fit the container. You can use objectFit to control cropping and scaling.\n\n\"contain\": The image will be scaled down to fit the container and preserve aspect ratio.\n\"cover\": The image will fill the container and be cropped.\n\nLearn more about position\n and object-fit\n.\n\nloader\n\nA custom function used to generate the image URL. The function receives the following parameters, and returns a URL string for the image:\n\nsrc\nwidth\nquality\n'use client'\n \nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nconst imageLoader = ({ src, width, quality }) => {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      loader={imageLoader}\n      src=\"me.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\n\nGood to know: Using props like onLoad, which accept a function, requires using Client Components\n to serialize the provided function.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the loaderFile configuration in next.config.js to configure every instance of next/image in your application, without passing a prop.\n\nsizes\n\nDefine the sizes of the image at different breakpoints. Used by the browser to choose the most appropriate size from the generated srcset.\n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"grid-element\">\n      <Image\n        fill\n        src=\"/example.png\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nsizes should be used when:\n\nThe image is using the fill prop\nCSS is used to make the image responsive\n\nIf sizes is missing, the browser assumes the image will be as wide as the viewport (100vw). This can cause unnecessarily large images to be downloaded.\n\nIn addition, sizes affects how srcset is generated:\n\nWithout sizes: Next.js generates a limited srcset (e.g. 1x, 2x), suitable for fixed-size images.\nWith sizes: Next.js generates a full srcset (e.g. 640w, 750w, etc.), optimized for responsive layouts.\n\nLearn more about srcset and sizes on web.dev\n and mdn\n.\n\nquality\n\nAn integer between 1 and 100 that sets the quality of the optimized image. Higher values increase file size and visual fidelity. Lower values reduce file size but may affect sharpness.\n\n// Default quality is 75\n<Image quality={75} />\n\nIf you’ve configured qualities in next.config.js, the value must match one of the allowed entries.\n\nGood to know: If the original image is already low quality, setting a high quality value will increase the file size without improving appearance.\n\nstyle\n\nAllows passing CSS styles to the underlying image element.\n\nconst imageStyle = {\n  borderRadius: '50%',\n  border: '1px solid #fff',\n  width: '100px',\n  height: 'auto',\n}\n \nexport default function ProfileImage() {\n  return <Image src=\"...\" style={imageStyle} />\n}\n\nGood to know: If you’re using the style prop to set a custom width, be sure to also set height: 'auto' to preserve the image’s aspect ratio.\n\npreload\n\nA boolean that indicates if the image should be preloaded.\n\n// Default preload is false\n<Image preload={false} />\ntrue: Preloads\n the image by inserting a <link> in the <head>.\nfalse: Does not preload the image.\n\nWhen to use it:\n\nThe image is the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n element.\nThe image is above the fold, typically the hero image.\nYou want to begin loading the image in the <head>, before its discovered later in the <body>.\n\nWhen not to use it:\n\nWhen you have multiple images that could be considered the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n element depending on the viewport.\nWhen the loading property is used.\nWhen the fetchPriority property is used.\n\nIn most cases, you should use loading=\"eager\" or fetchPriority=\"high\" instead of preload.\n\npriority\n\nStarting with Next.js 16, the priority property has been deprecated in favor of the preload property in order to make the behavior clear.\n\nloading\n\nControls when the image should start loading.\n\n// Defaults to lazy\n<Image loading=\"lazy\" />\nlazy: Defer loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport.\neager: Load the image immediately, regardless of its position in the page.\n\nUse eager only when you want to ensure the image is loaded immediately.\n\nLearn more about the loading attribute\n.\n\nplaceholder\n\nSpecifies a placeholder to use while the image is loading, improving the perceived loading performance.\n\n// defaults to empty\n<Image placeholder=\"empty\" />\nempty: No placeholder while the image is loading.\nblur: Use a blurred version of the image as a placeholder. Must be used with the blurDataURL property.\ndata:image/...: Uses the Data URL\n as the placeholder.\n\nExamples:\n\nblur placeholder\nShimmer effect with data URL placeholder prop\nColor effect with blurDataURL prop\n\nLearn more about the placeholder attribute\n.\n\nblurDataURL\n\nA Data URL\n to be used as a placeholder image before the image successfully loads. Can be automatically set or used with the placeholder=\"blur\" property.\n\n<Image placeholder=\"blur\" blurDataURL=\"...\" />\n\nThe image is automatically enlarged and blurred, so a very small image (10px or less) is recommended.\n\nAutomatic\n\nIf src is a static import of a jpg, png, webp, or avif file, blurDataURL is added automatically—unless the image is animated.\n\nManually set\n\nIf the image is dynamic or remote, you must provide blurDataURL yourself. To generate one, you can use:\n\nA online tool like png-pixel.com\nA library like Plaiceholder\n\nA large blurDataURL may hurt performance. Keep it small and simple.\n\nExamples:\n\nDefault blurDataURL prop\nColor effect with blurDataURL prop\nonLoad\n\nA callback function that is invoked once the image is completely loaded and the placeholder has been removed.\n\n<Image onLoad={(e) => console.log(e.target.naturalWidth)} />\n\nThe callback function will be called with one argument, the event which has a target that references the underlying <img> element.\n\nGood to know: Using props like onLoad, which accept a function, requires using Client Components\n to serialize the provided function.\n\nonError\n\nA callback function that is invoked if the image fails to load.\n\n<Image onError={(e) => console.error(e.target.id)} />\n\nGood to know: Using props like onError, which accept a function, requires using Client Components\n to serialize the provided function.\n\nunoptimized\n\nA boolean that indicates if the image should be optimized. This is useful for images that do not benefit from optimization such as small images (less than 1KB), vector images (SVG), or animated images (GIF).\n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nconst UnoptimizedImage = (props) => {\n  // Default is false\n  return <Image {...props} unoptimized />\n}\ntrue: The source image will be served as-is from the src instead of changing quality, size, or format.\nfalse: The source image will be optimized.\n\nSince Next.js 12.3.0, this prop can be assigned to all images by updating next.config.js with the following configuration:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    unoptimized: true,\n  },\n}\noverrideSrc\n\nWhen providing the src prop to the <Image> component, both the srcset and src attributes are generated automatically for the resulting <img>.\n\ninput.js\n<Image src=\"/profile.jpg\" />\noutput.html\n<img\n  srcset=\"\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fprofile.jpg&w=640&q=75 1x,\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fprofile.jpg&w=828&q=75 2x\n  \"\n  src=\"/_next/image?url=%2Fprofile.jpg&w=828&q=75\"\n/>\n\nIn some cases, it is not desirable to have the src attribute generated and you may wish to override it using the overrideSrc prop.\n\nFor example, when upgrading an existing website from <img> to <Image>, you may wish to maintain the same src attribute for SEO purposes such as image ranking or avoiding recrawl.\n\ninput.js\n<Image src=\"/profile.jpg\" overrideSrc=\"/override.jpg\" />\noutput.html\n<img\n  srcset=\"\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fprofile.jpg&w=640&q=75 1x,\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fprofile.jpg&w=828&q=75 2x\n  \"\n  src=\"/override.jpg\"\n/>\ndecoding\n\nA hint to the browser indicating if it should wait for the image to be decoded before presenting other content updates or not.\n\n// Default is async\n<Image decoding=\"async\" />\nasync: Asynchronously decode the image and allow other content to be rendered before it completes.\nsync: Synchronously decode the image for atomic presentation with other content.\nauto: No preference. The browser chooses the best approach.\n\nLearn more about the decoding attribute\n.\n\nOther Props\n\nOther properties on the <Image /> component will be passed to the underlying img element with the exception of the following:\n\nsrcSet: Use Device Sizes instead.\nDeprecated props\nonLoadingComplete\n\nWarning: Deprecated in Next.js 14, use onLoad instead.\n\nA callback function that is invoked once the image is completely loaded and the placeholder has been removed.\n\nThe callback function will be called with one argument, a reference to the underlying <img> element.\n\n'use client'\n \n<Image onLoadingComplete={(img) => console.log(img.naturalWidth)} />\n\nGood to know: Using props like onLoadingComplete, which accept a function, requires using Client Components\n to serialize the provided function.\n\nConfiguration options\n\nYou can configure the Image Component in next.config.js. The following options are available:\n\nlocalPatterns\n\nUse localPatterns in your next.config.js file to allow images from specific local paths to be optimized and block all others.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    localPatterns: [\n      {\n        pathname: '/assets/images/**',\n        search: '',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nThe example above will ensure the src property of next/image must start with /assets/images/ and must not have a query string. Attempting to optimize any other path will respond with 400 Bad Request error.\n\nGood to know: Omitting the search property allows all search parameters which could allow malicious actors to optimize URLs you did not intend. Try using a specific value like search: '?v=2' to ensure an exact match.\n\nremotePatterns\n\nUse remotePatterns in your next.config.js file to allow images from specific external paths and block all others. This ensures that only external images from your account can be served.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [new URL('https://example.com/account123/**')],\n  },\n}\n\nYou can also configure remotePatterns using the object:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'example.com',\n        port: '',\n        pathname: '/account123/**',\n        search: '',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nThe example above will ensure the src property of next/image must start with https://example.com/account123/ and must not have a query string. Any other protocol, hostname, port, or unmatched path will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nWildcard Patterns:\n\nWildcard patterns can be used for both pathname and hostname and have the following syntax:\n\n* match a single path segment or subdomain\n** match any number of path segments at the end or subdomains at the beginning. This syntax does not work in the middle of the pattern.\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: '**.example.com',\n        port: '',\n        search: '',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nThis allows subdomains like image.example.com. Query strings and custom ports are still blocked.\n\nGood to know: When omitting protocol, port, pathname, or search then the wildcard ** is implied. This is not recommended because it may allow malicious actors to optimize urls you did not intend.\n\nQuery Strings:\n\nYou can also restrict query strings using the search property:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'assets.example.com',\n        search: '?v=1727111025337',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nThe example above will ensure the src property of next/image must start with https://assets.example.com and must have the exact query string ?v=1727111025337. Any other protocol or query string will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nloaderFile\n\nloaderFiles allows you to use a custom image optimization service instead of Next.js.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    loader: 'custom',\n    loaderFile: './my/image/loader.js',\n  },\n}\n\nThe path must be relative to the project root. The file must export a default function that returns a URL string:\n\nmy/image/loader.js\n'use client'\n \nexport default function myImageLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n\nExample:\n\nCustom Image Loader Configuration\n\nAlternatively, you can use the loader prop to configure each instance of next/image.\n\npath\n\nIf you want to change or prefix the default path for the Image Optimization API, you can do so with the path property. The default value for path is /_next/image.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    path: '/my-prefix/_next/image',\n  },\n}\ndeviceSizes\n\ndeviceSizes allows you to specify a list of device width breakpoints. These widths are used when the next/image component uses sizes prop to ensure the correct image is served for the user's device.\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],\n  },\n}\nimageSizes\n\nimageSizes allows you to specify a list of image widths. These widths are concatenated with the array of device sizes to form the full array of sizes used to generate image srcset\n.\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    imageSizes: [32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],\n  },\n}\n\nimageSizes is only used for images which provide a sizes prop, which indicates that the image is less than the full width of the screen. Therefore, the sizes in imageSizes should all be smaller than the smallest size in deviceSizes.\n\nqualities\n\nqualities allows you to specify a list of image quality values.\n\nIf not configuration is provided, the default below is used:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    qualities: [75],\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: This field is required starting with Next.js 16 because unrestricted access could allow malicious actors to optimize more qualities than you intended.\n\nYou can add more image qualities to the allowlist, such as the following:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    qualities: [25, 50, 75, 100],\n  },\n}\n\nIn the example above, only four qualities are allowed: 25, 50, 75, and 100.\n\nIf the quality prop does not match a value in this array, the closest allowed value will be used.\n\nIf the REST API is visited directly with a quality that does not match a value in this array, the server will return a 400 Bad Request response.\n\nformats\n\nformats allows you to specify a list of image formats to be used.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    // Default\n    formats: ['image/webp'],\n  },\n}\n\nNext.js automatically detects the browser's supported image formats via the request's Accept header in order to determine the best output format.\n\nIf the Accept header matches more than one of the configured formats, the first match in the array is used. Therefore, the array order matters. If there is no match (or the source image is animated), it will use the original image's format.\n\nYou can enable AVIF support, which will fallback to the original format of the src image if the browser does not support AVIF\n:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/avif'],\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nWe still recommend using WebP for most use cases.\nAVIF generally takes 50% longer to encode but it compresses 20% smaller compared to WebP. This means that the first time an image is requested, it will typically be slower, but subsequent requests that are cached will be faster.\nIf you self-host with a Proxy/CDN in front of Next.js, you must configure the Proxy to forward the Accept header.\nminimumCacheTTL\n\nminimumCacheTTL allows you to configure the Time to Live (TTL) in seconds for cached optimized images. In many cases, it's better to use a Static Image Import which will automatically hash the file contents and cache the image forever with a Cache-Control header of immutable.\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    minimumCacheTTL: 14400, // 4 hours\n  },\n}\n\nYou can increase the TTL to reduce the number of revalidations and potentially lower cost:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    minimumCacheTTL: 2678400, // 31 days\n  },\n}\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) of the optimized image is defined by either the minimumCacheTTL or the upstream image Cache-Control header, whichever is larger.\n\nIf you need to change the caching behavior per image, you can configure headers to set the Cache-Control header on the upstream image (e.g. /some-asset.jpg, not /_next/image itself).\n\nThere is no mechanism to invalidate the cache at this time, so its best to keep minimumCacheTTL low. Otherwise you may need to manually change the src prop or delete the cached file <distDir>/cache/images.\n\ndisableStaticImages\n\ndisableStaticImages allows you to disable static image imports.\n\nThe default behavior allows you to import static files such as import icon from './icon.png' and then pass that to the src property. In some cases, you may wish to disable this feature if it conflicts with other plugins that expect the import to behave differently.\n\nYou can disable static image imports inside your next.config.js:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    disableStaticImages: true,\n  },\n}\nmaximumRedirects\n\nThe default image optimization loader will follow HTTP redirects when fetching remote images up to 3 times.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    maximumRedirects: 3,\n  },\n}\n\nYou can configure the number of redirects to follow when fetching remote images. Setting the value to 0 will disable following redirects.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    maximumRedirects: 0,\n  },\n}\ndangerouslyAllowLocalIP\n\nIn rare cases when self-hosting Next.js on a private network, you may want to allow optimizing images from local IP addresses on the same network. This is not recommended for most users because it could allow malicious users to access content on your internal network.\n\nBy default, the value is false.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    dangerouslyAllowLocalIP: false,\n  },\n}\n\nIf you need to optimize remote images hosted elsewhere in your local network, you can set the value to true.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    dangerouslyAllowLocalIP: true,\n  },\n}\ndangerouslyAllowSVG\n\ndangerouslyAllowSVG allows you to serve SVG images.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    dangerouslyAllowSVG: true,\n  },\n}\n\nBy default, Next.js does not optimize SVG images for a few reasons:\n\nSVG is a vector format meaning it can be resized losslessly.\nSVG has many of the same features as HTML/CSS, which can lead to vulnerabilities without proper Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.\n\nWe recommend using the unoptimized prop when the src prop is known to be SVG. This happens automatically when src ends with \".svg\".\n\n<Image src=\"/my-image.svg\" unoptimized />\n\nIn addition, it is strongly recommended to also set contentDispositionType to force the browser to download the image, as well as contentSecurityPolicy to prevent scripts embedded in the image from executing.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    dangerouslyAllowSVG: true,\n    contentDispositionType: 'attachment',\n    contentSecurityPolicy: \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; sandbox;\",\n  },\n}\ncontentDispositionType\n\ncontentDispositionType allows you to configure the Content-Disposition\n header.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    contentDispositionType: 'inline',\n  },\n}\ncontentSecurityPolicy\n\ncontentSecurityPolicy allows you to configure the Content-Security-Policy\n header for images. This is particularly important when using dangerouslyAllowSVG to prevent scripts embedded in the image from executing.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    contentSecurityPolicy: \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; sandbox;\",\n  },\n}\n\nBy default, the loader sets the Content-Disposition\n header to attachment for added protection since the API can serve arbitrary remote images.\n\nThe default value is attachment which forces the browser to download the image when visiting directly. This is particularly important when dangerouslyAllowSVG is true.\n\nYou can optionally configure inline to allow the browser to render the image when visiting directly, without downloading it.\n\nDeprecated configuration options\ndomains\n\nWarning: Deprecated since Next.js 14 in favor of strict remotePatterns in order to protect your application from malicious users.\n\nSimilar to remotePatterns, the domains configuration can be used to provide a list of allowed hostnames for external images. However, the domains configuration does not support wildcard pattern matching and it cannot restrict protocol, port, or pathname.\n\nSince most remote image servers are shared between multiple tenants, it's safer to use remotePatterns to ensure only the intended images are optimized.\n\nBelow is an example of the domains property in the next.config.js file:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    domains: ['assets.acme.com'],\n  },\n}\nFunctions\ngetImageProps\n\nThe getImageProps function can be used to get the props that would be passed to the underlying <img> element, and instead pass them to another component, style, canvas, etc.\n\nimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \nconst { props } = getImageProps({\n  src: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',\n  alt: 'A scenic mountain view',\n  width: 1200,\n  height: 800,\n})\n \nfunction ImageWithCaption() {\n  return (\n    <figure>\n      <img {...props} />\n      <figcaption>A scenic mountain view</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n  )\n}\n\nThis also avoid calling React useState() so it can lead to better performance, but it cannot be used with the placeholder prop because the placeholder will never be removed.\n\nKnown browser bugs\n\nThis next/image component uses browser native lazy loading\n, which may fallback to eager loading for older browsers before Safari 15.4. When using the blur-up placeholder, older browsers before Safari 12 will fallback to empty placeholder. When using styles with width/height of auto, it is possible to cause Layout Shift\n on older browsers before Safari 15 that don't preserve the aspect ratio\n. For more details, see this MDN video\n.\n\nSafari 15 - 16.3\n display a gray border while loading. Safari 16.4 fixed this issue\n. Possible solutions:\nUse CSS @supports (font: -apple-system-body) and (-webkit-appearance: none) { img[loading=\"lazy\"] { clip-path: inset(0.6px) } }\nUse loading=\"eager\" if the image is above the fold\nFirefox 67+\n displays a white background while loading. Possible solutions:\nEnable AVIF formats\nUse placeholder\nExamples\nStyling images\n\nStyling the Image component is similar to styling a normal <img> element, but there are a few guidelines to keep in mind:\n\nUse className or style, not styled-jsx. In most cases, we recommend using the className prop. This can be an imported CSS Module, a global stylesheet, etc.\n\nimport styles from './styles.module.css'\n \nexport default function MyImage() {\n  return <Image className={styles.image} src=\"/my-image.png\" alt=\"My Image\" />\n}\n\nYou can also use the style prop to assign inline styles.\n\nexport default function MyImage() {\n  return (\n    <Image style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }} src=\"/my-image.png\" alt=\"My Image\" />\n  )\n}\n\nWhen using fill, the parent element must have position: relative or display: block. This is necessary for the proper rendering of the image element in that layout mode.\n\n<div style={{ position: 'relative' }}>\n  <Image fill src=\"/my-image.png\" alt=\"My Image\" />\n</div>\n\nYou cannot use styled-jsx because it's scoped to the current component (unless you mark the style as global).\n\nResponsive images with a static export\n\nWhen you import a static image, Next.js automatically sets its width and height based on the file. You can make the image responsive by setting the style:\n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n \nexport default function Responsive() {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>\n      <Image\n        alt=\"Mountains\"\n        // Importing an image will\n        // automatically set the width and height\n        src={mountains}\n        sizes=\"100vw\"\n        // Make the image display full width\n        // and preserve its aspect ratio\n        style={{\n          width: '100%',\n          height: 'auto',\n        }}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nResponsive images with a remote URL\n\nIf the source image is a dynamic or a remote URL, you must provide the width and height props so Next.js can calculate the aspect ratio:\n\ncomponents/page.js\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page({ photoUrl }) {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={photoUrl}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        width: '100%',\n        height: 'auto',\n      }}\n      width={500}\n      height={300}\n    />\n  )\n}\n\nTry it out:\n\nDemo the image responsive to viewport\nResponsive image with fill\n\nIf you don't know the aspect ratio of the image, you can add the fill prop with the objectFit prop set to cover. This will make the image fill the full width of its parent container.\n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n \nexport default function Fill() {\n  return (\n    <div\n      style={{\n        display: 'grid',\n        gridGap: '8px',\n        gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fit, minmax(400px, auto))',\n      }}\n    >\n      <div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '400px' }}>\n        <Image\n          alt=\"Mountains\"\n          src={mountains}\n          fill\n          sizes=\"(min-width: 808px) 50vw, 100vw\"\n          style={{\n            objectFit: 'cover', // cover, contain, none\n          }}\n        />\n      </div>\n      {/* And more images in the grid... */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nBackground Image\n\nUse the fill prop to make the image cover the entire screen area:\n\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n \nexport default function Background() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      alt=\"Mountains\"\n      src={mountains}\n      placeholder=\"blur\"\n      quality={100}\n      fill\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        objectFit: 'cover',\n      }}\n    />\n  )\n}\n\nFor examples of the Image component used with the various styles, see the Image Component Demo\n.\n\nRemote images\n\nTo use a remote image, the src property should be a URL string.\n\napp/page.js\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/profile.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\n\nSince Next.js does not have access to remote files during the build process, you'll need to provide the width, height and optional blurDataURL props manually.\n\nThe width and height attributes are used to infer the correct aspect ratio of image and avoid layout shift from the image loading in. The width and height do not determine the rendered size of the image file.\n\nTo safely allow optimizing images, define a list of supported URL patterns in next.config.js. Be as specific as possible to prevent malicious usage. For example, the following configuration will only allow images from a specific AWS S3 bucket:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 's3.amazonaws.com',\n        port: '',\n        pathname: '/my-bucket/**',\n        search: '',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\nTheme detection\n\nIf you want to display a different image for light and dark mode, you can create a new component that wraps two <Image> components and reveals the correct one based on a CSS media query.\n\ncomponents/theme-image.module.css\n.imgDark {\n  display: none;\n}\n \n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  .imgLight {\n    display: none;\n  }\n  .imgDark {\n    display: unset;\n  }\n}\ncomponents/theme-image.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport styles from './theme-image.module.css'\nimport Image, { ImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \ntype Props = Omit<ImageProps, 'src' | 'preload' | 'loading'> & {\n  srcLight: string\n  srcDark: string\n}\n \nconst ThemeImage = (props: Props) => {\n  const { srcLight, srcDark, ...rest } = props\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <Image {...rest} src={srcLight} className={styles.imgLight} />\n      <Image {...rest} src={srcDark} className={styles.imgDark} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nGood to know: The default behavior of loading=\"lazy\" ensures that only the correct image is loaded. You cannot use preload or loading=\"eager\" because that would cause both images to load. Instead, you can use fetchPriority=\"high\"\n.\n\nTry it out:\n\nDemo light/dark mode theme detection\nArt direction\n\nIf you want to display a different image for mobile and desktop, sometimes called Art Direction\n, you can provide different src, width, height, and quality props to getImageProps().\n\napp/page.js\nimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  const common = { alt: 'Art Direction Example', sizes: '100vw' }\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: desktop },\n  } = getImageProps({\n    ...common,\n    width: 1440,\n    height: 875,\n    quality: 80,\n    src: '/desktop.jpg',\n  })\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: mobile, ...rest },\n  } = getImageProps({\n    ...common,\n    width: 750,\n    height: 1334,\n    quality: 70,\n    src: '/mobile.jpg',\n  })\n \n  return (\n    <picture>\n      <source media=\"(min-width: 1000px)\" srcSet={desktop} />\n      <source media=\"(min-width: 500px)\" srcSet={mobile} />\n      <img {...rest} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />\n    </picture>\n  )\n}\nBackground CSS\n\nYou can even convert the srcSet string to the image-set()\n CSS function to optimize a background image.\n\napp/page.js\nimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \nfunction getBackgroundImage(srcSet = '') {\n  const imageSet = srcSet\n    .split(', ')\n    .map((str) => {\n      const [url, dpi] = str.split(' ')\n      return `url(\"${url}\") ${dpi}`\n    })\n    .join(', ')\n  return `image-set(${imageSet})`\n}\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet },\n  } = getImageProps({ alt: '', width: 128, height: 128, src: '/img.png' })\n  const backgroundImage = getBackgroundImage(srcSet)\n  const style = { height: '100vh', width: '100vw', backgroundImage }\n \n  return (\n    <main style={style}>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv16.0.0\tqualities default configuration changed to [75], preload prop added, priority prop deprecated, dangerouslyAllowLocalIP config added, maximumRedirects config added.\nv15.3.0\tremotePatterns added support for array of URL objects.\nv15.0.0\tcontentDispositionType configuration default changed to attachment.\nv14.2.23\tqualities configuration added.\nv14.2.15\tdecoding prop added and localPatterns configuration added.\nv14.2.14\tremotePatterns.search prop added.\nv14.2.0\toverrideSrc prop added.\nv14.1.0\tgetImageProps() is stable.\nv14.0.0\tonLoadingComplete prop and domains config deprecated.\nv13.4.14\tplaceholder prop support for data:/image...\nv13.2.0\tcontentDispositionType configuration added.\nv13.0.6\tref prop added.\nv13.0.0\tThe next/image import was renamed to next/legacy/image.

    "html": "API Reference\nComponents\nLink Component\nCopy page\nLink Component\n\n<Link> is a React component that extends the HTML <a> element to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes. It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.\n\nBasic usage:\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Link href=\"/dashboard\">Dashboard</Link>\n}\nReference\n\nThe following props can be passed to the <Link> component:\n\nProp\tExample\tType\tRequired\nhref\thref=\"/dashboard\"\tString or Object\tYes\nreplace\treplace={false}\tBoolean\t-\nscroll\tscroll={false}\tBoolean\t-\nprefetch\tprefetch={false}\tBoolean or null\t-\nonNavigate\tonNavigate={(e) => {}}\tFunction\t-\n\nGood to know: <a> tag attributes such as className or target=\"_blank\" can be added to <Link> as props and will be passed to the underlying <a> element.\n\nhref (required)\n\nThe path or URL to navigate to.\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \n// Navigate to /about?name=test\nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link\n      href={{\n        pathname: '/about',\n        query: { name: 'test' },\n      }}\n    >\n      About\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\nreplace\n\nDefaults to false. When true, next/link will replace the current history state instead of adding a new URL into the browser's history\n stack.\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/dashboard\" replace>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\nscroll\n\nDefaults to true. The default scrolling behavior of <Link> in Next.js is to maintain scroll position, similar to how browsers handle back and forwards navigation. When you navigate to a new Page, scroll position will stay the same as long as the Page is visible in the viewport. However, if the Page is not visible in the viewport, Next.js will scroll to the top of the first Page element.\n\nWhen scroll = {false}, Next.js will not attempt to scroll to the first Page element.\n\nGood to know: Next.js checks if scroll: false before managing scroll behavior. If scrolling is enabled, it identifies the relevant DOM node for navigation and inspects each top-level element. All non-scrollable elements and those without rendered HTML are bypassed, this includes sticky or fixed positioned elements, and non-visible elements such as those calculated with getBoundingClientRect. Next.js then continues through siblings until it identifies a scrollable element that is visible in the viewport.\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/dashboard\" scroll={false}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\nprefetch\n\nPrefetching happens when a <Link /> component enters the user's viewport (initially or through scroll). Next.js prefetches and loads the linked route (denoted by the href) and its data in the background to improve the performance of client-side navigations. If the prefetched data has expired by the time the user hovers over a <Link />, Next.js will attempt to prefetch it again. Prefetching is only enabled in production.\n\nThe following values can be passed to the prefetch prop:\n\n\"auto\" or null (default): Prefetch behavior depends on whether the route is static or dynamic. For static routes, the full route will be prefetched (including all its data). For dynamic routes, the partial route down to the nearest segment with a loading.js boundary will be prefetched.\ntrue: The full route will be prefetched for both static and dynamic routes.\nfalse: Prefetching will never happen both on entering the viewport and on hover.\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/dashboard\" prefetch={false}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\nonNavigate\n\nAn event handler called during client-side navigation. The handler receives an event object that includes a preventDefault() method, allowing you to cancel the navigation if needed.\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link\n      href=\"/dashboard\"\n      onNavigate={(e) => {\n        // Only executes during SPA navigation\n        console.log('Navigating...')\n \n        // Optionally prevent navigation\n        // e.preventDefault()\n      }}\n    >\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n\nGood to know: While onClick and onNavigate may seem similar, they serve different purposes. onClick executes for all click events, while onNavigate only runs during client-side navigation. Some key differences:\n\nWhen using modifier keys (Ctrl/Cmd + Click), onClick executes but onNavigate doesn't since Next.js prevents default navigation for new tabs.\nExternal URLs won't trigger onNavigate since it's only for client-side and same-origin navigations.\nLinks with the download attribute will work with onClick but not onNavigate since the browser will treat the linked URL as a download.\nExamples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to use the <Link> component in different scenarios.\n\nLinking to dynamic route segments\n\nWhen linking to dynamic segments, you can use template literals and interpolation\n to generate a list of links. For example, to generate a list of blog posts:\n\napp/blog/post-list.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \ninterface Post {\n  id: number\n  title: string\n  slug: string\n}\n \nexport default function PostList({ posts }: { posts: Post[] }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>\n          <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\nChecking active links\n\nYou can use usePathname() to determine if a link is active. For example, to add a class to the active link, you can check if the current pathname matches the href of the link:\n\napp/ui/nav-links.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport function Links() {\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n \n  return (\n    <nav>\n      <Link className={`link ${pathname === '/' ? 'active' : ''}`} href=\"/\">\n        Home\n      </Link>\n \n      <Link\n        className={`link ${pathname === '/about' ? 'active' : ''}`}\n        href=\"/about\"\n      >\n        About\n      </Link>\n    </nav>\n  )\n}\nScrolling to an id\n\nIf you'd like to scroll to a specific id on navigation, you can append your URL with a # hash link or just pass a hash link to the href prop. This is possible since <Link> renders to an <a> element.\n\n<Link href=\"/dashboard#settings\">Settings</Link>\n \n// Output\n<a href=\"/dashboard#settings\">Settings</a>\n\nGood to know:\n\nNext.js will scroll to the Page if it is not visible in the viewport upon navigation.\nReplace the URL instead of push\n\nThe default behavior of the Link component is to push a new URL into the history stack. You can use the replace prop to prevent adding a new entry, as in the following example:\n\napp/page.js\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/about\" replace>\n      About us\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\nDisable scrolling to the top of the page\n\nThe default scrolling behavior of <Link> in Next.js is to maintain scroll position, similar to how browsers handle back and forwards navigation. When you navigate to a new Page, scroll position will stay the same as long as the Page is visible in the viewport.\n\nHowever, if the Page is not visible in the viewport, Next.js will scroll to the top of the first Page element. If you'd like to disable this behavior, you can pass scroll={false} to the <Link> component, or scroll: false to router.push() or router.replace().\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/#hashid\" scroll={false}>\n      Disables scrolling to the top\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n\nUsing router.push() or router.replace():\n\n// useRouter\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n \nconst router = useRouter()\n \nrouter.push('/dashboard', { scroll: false })\nPrefetching links in Proxy\n\nIt's common to use Proxy for authentication or other purposes that involve rewriting the user to a different page. In order for the <Link /> component to properly prefetch links with rewrites via Proxy, you need to tell Next.js both the URL to display and the URL to prefetch. This is required to avoid un-necessary fetches to proxy to know the correct route to prefetch.\n\nFor example, if you want to serve a /dashboard route that has authenticated and visitor views, you can add the following in your Proxy to redirect the user to the correct page:\n\nproxy.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function proxy(request: Request) {\n  const nextUrl = request.nextUrl\n  if (nextUrl.pathname === '/dashboard') {\n    if (request.cookies.authToken) {\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/auth/dashboard', request.url))\n    } else {\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/public/dashboard', request.url))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIn this case, you would want to use the following code in your <Link /> component:\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport useIsAuthed from './hooks/useIsAuthed' // Your auth hook\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const isAuthed = useIsAuthed()\n  const path = isAuthed ? '/auth/dashboard' : '/public/dashboard'\n  return (\n    <Link as=\"/dashboard\" href={path}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\nBlocking navigation\n\nYou can use the onNavigate prop to block navigation when certain conditions are met, such as when a form has unsaved changes. When you need to block navigation across multiple components in your app (like preventing navigation from any link while a form is being edited), React Context provides a clean way to share this blocking state. First, create a context to track the navigation blocking state:\n\napp/contexts/navigation-blocker.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { createContext, useState, useContext } from 'react'\n \ninterface NavigationBlockerContextType {\n  isBlocked: boolean\n  setIsBlocked: (isBlocked: boolean) => void\n}\n \nexport const NavigationBlockerContext =\n  createContext<NavigationBlockerContextType>({\n    isBlocked: false,\n    setIsBlocked: () => {},\n  })\n \nexport function NavigationBlockerProvider({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  const [isBlocked, setIsBlocked] = useState(false)\n \n  return (\n    <NavigationBlockerContext.Provider value={{ isBlocked, setIsBlocked }}>\n      {children}\n    </NavigationBlockerContext.Provider>\n  )\n}\n \nexport function useNavigationBlocker() {\n  return useContext(NavigationBlockerContext)\n}\n\nCreate a form component that uses the context:\n\napp/components/form.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { useNavigationBlocker } from '../contexts/navigation-blocker'\n \nexport default function Form() {\n  const { setIsBlocked } = useNavigationBlocker()\n \n  return (\n    <form\n      onSubmit={(e) => {\n        e.preventDefault()\n        setIsBlocked(false)\n      }}\n      onChange={() => setIsBlocked(true)}\n    >\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Save</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n\nCreate a custom Link component that blocks navigation:\n\napp/components/custom-link.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport { useNavigationBlocker } from '../contexts/navigation-blocker'\n \ninterface CustomLinkProps extends React.ComponentProps<typeof Link> {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}\n \nexport function CustomLink({ children, ...props }: CustomLinkProps) {\n  const { isBlocked } = useNavigationBlocker()\n \n  return (\n    <Link\n      onNavigate={(e) => {\n        if (\n          isBlocked &&\n          !window.confirm('You have unsaved changes. Leave anyway?')\n        ) {\n          e.preventDefault()\n        }\n      }}\n      {...props}\n    >\n      {children}\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n\nCreate a navigation component:\n\napp/components/nav.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { CustomLink as Link } from './custom-link'\n \nexport default function Nav() {\n  return (\n    <nav>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </nav>\n  )\n}\n\nFinally, wrap your app with the NavigationBlockerProvider in the root layout and use the components in your page:\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { NavigationBlockerProvider } from './contexts/navigation-blocker'\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <NavigationBlockerProvider>{children}</NavigationBlockerProvider>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nThen, use the Nav and Form components in your page:\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Nav from './components/nav'\nimport Form from './components/form'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Nav />\n      <main>\n        <h1>Welcome to the Dashboard</h1>\n        <Form />\n      </main>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nWhen a user tries to navigate away using CustomLink while the form has unsaved changes, they'll be prompted to confirm before leaving.\n\nVersion history\nVersion\tChanges\nv15.4.0\tAdd auto as an alias to the default prefetch behavior.\nv15.3.0\tAdd onNavigate API\nv13.0.0\tNo longer requires a child <a> tag.

This can be either an absolute external URL or an internal path. The src property is required unless an inline script is used.\n\nOptional Props\n\nThe <Script /> component accepts a number of additional properties beyond those which are required.\n\nstrategy\n\nThe loading strategy of the script. There are four different strategies that can be used:\n\nbeforeInteractive: Load before any Next.js code and before any page hydration occurs.\nafterInteractive: (default) Load early but after some hydration on the page occurs.\nlazyOnload: Load during browser idle time.\nworker: (experimental) Load in a web worker.\nbeforeInteractive\n\nScripts that load with the beforeInteractive strategy are injected into the initial HTML from the server, downloaded before any Next.js module, and executed in the order they are placed.\n\nScripts denoted with this strategy are preloaded and fetched before any first-party code, but their execution does not block page hydration from occurring.\n\nbeforeInteractive scripts must be placed inside the root layout (app/layout.tsx) and are designed to load scripts that are needed by the entire site (i.e. the script will load when any page in the application has been loaded server-side).\n\nThis strategy should only be used for critical scripts that need to be fetched as soon as possible.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        {children}\n        <Script\n          src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n          strategy=\"beforeInteractive\"\n        />\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nGood to know: Scripts with beforeInteractive will always be injected inside the head of the HTML document regardless of where it's placed in the component.\n\nSome examples of scripts that should be fetched as soon as possible with beforeInteractive include:\n\nBot detectors\nCookie consent managers\nafterInteractive\n\nScripts that use the afterInteractive strategy are injected into the HTML client-side and will load after some (or all) hydration occurs on the page. This is the default strategy of the Script component and should be used for any script that needs to load as soon as possible but not before any first-party Next.js code.\n\nafterInteractive scripts can be placed inside of any page or layout and will only load and execute when that page (or group of pages) is opened in the browser.\n\napp/page.js\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"afterInteractive\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nSome examples of scripts that are good candidates for afterInteractive include:\n\nTag managers\nAnalytics\nlazyOnload\n\nScripts that use the lazyOnload strategy are injected into the HTML client-side during browser idle time and will load after all resources on the page have been fetched. This strategy should be used for any background or low priority scripts that do not need to load early.\n\nlazyOnload scripts can be placed inside of any page or layout and will only load and execute when that page (or group of pages) is opened in the browser.\n\napp/page.js\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"lazyOnload\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nExamples of scripts that do not need to load immediately and can be fetched with lazyOnload include:\n\nChat support plugins\nSocial media widgets\nworker\n\nWarning: The worker strategy is not yet stable and does not yet work with the App Router. Use with caution.\n\nScripts that use the worker strategy are off-loaded to a web worker in order to free up the main thread and ensure that only critical, first-party resources are processed on it. While this strategy can be used for any script, it is an advanced use case that is not guaranteed to support all third-party scripts.\n\nTo use worker as a strategy, the nextScriptWorkers flag must be enabled in next.config.js:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    nextScriptWorkers: true,\n  },\n}\n\nworker scripts can only currently be used in the pages/ directory:\n\npages/home.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"worker\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\nonLoad\n\nWarning: onLoad does not yet work with Server Components and can only be used in Client Components. Further, onLoad can't be used with beforeInteractive – consider using onReady instead.\n\nSome third-party scripts require users to run JavaScript code once after the script has finished loading in order to instantiate content or call a function. If you are loading a script with either afterInteractive or lazyOnload as a loading strategy, you can execute code after it has loaded using the onLoad property.\n\nHere's an example of executing a lodash method only after the library has been loaded.\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.20/lodash.min.js\"\n        onLoad={() => {\n          console.log(_.sample([1, 2, 3, 4]))\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\nonReady\n\nWarning: onReady does not yet work with Server Components and can only be used in Client Components.\n\nSome third-party scripts require users to run JavaScript code after the script has finished loading and every time the component is mounted (after a route navigation for example). You can execute code after the script's load event when it first loads and then after every subsequent component re-mount using the onReady property.\n\nHere's an example of how to re-instantiate a Google Maps JS embed every time the component is mounted:\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { useRef } from 'react'\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const mapRef = useRef()\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <div ref={mapRef}></div>\n      <Script\n        id=\"google-maps\"\n        src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js\"\n        onReady={() => {\n          new google.maps.Map(mapRef.current, {\n            center: { lat: -34.397, lng: 150.644 },\n            zoom: 8,\n          })\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\nonError\n\nWarning: onError does not yet work with Server Components and can only be used in Client Components. onError cannot be used with the beforeInteractive loading strategy.\n\nSometimes it is helpful to catch when a script fails to load.

For example, a blog could include the following route app/blog/[slug]/page.js where [slug] is the Dynamic Segment for blog posts.\n\napp/blog/[slug]/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default async function Page({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>\n}) {\n  const { slug } = await params\n  return <div>My Post: {slug}</div>\n}\n\nDynamic Segments are passed as the params prop to layout, page, route, and generateMetadata functions.\n\nRoute\tExample URL\tparams\napp/blog/[slug]/page.js\t/blog/a\t{ slug: 'a' }\napp/blog/[slug]/page.js\t/blog/b\t{ slug: 'b' }\napp/blog/[slug]/page.js\t/blog/c\t{ slug: 'c' }\nIn Client Components\n\nIn a Client Component page, dynamic segments from props can be accessed using the use\n hook.\n\napp/blog/[slug]/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\nimport { use } from 'react'\n \nexport default function BlogPostPage({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>\n}) {\n  const { slug } = use(params)\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>{slug}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nAlternatively Client Components can use the useParams hook to access the params anywhere in the Client Component tree.\n\nCatch-all Segments\n\nDynamic Segments can be extended to catch-all subsequent segments by adding an ellipsis inside the brackets [...folderName].\n\nFor example, app/shop/[...slug]/page.js will match /shop/clothes, but also /shop/clothes/tops, /shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts, and so on.\n\nRoute\tExample URL\tparams\napp/shop/[...slug]/page.js\t/shop/a\t{ slug: ['a'] }\napp/shop/[...slug]/page.js\t/shop/a/b\t{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }\napp/shop/[...slug]/page.js\t/shop/a/b/c\t{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }\nOptional Catch-all Segments\n\nCatch-all Segments can be made optional by including the parameter in double square brackets: [[...folderName]].\n\nFor example, app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js will also match /shop, in addition to /shop/clothes, /shop/clothes/tops, /shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts.\n\nThe difference between catch-all and optional catch-all segments is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (/shop in the example above).\n\nRoute\tExample URL\tparams\napp/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js\t/shop\t{ slug: undefined }\napp/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js\t/shop/a\t{ slug: ['a'] }\napp/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js\t/shop/a/b\t{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }\napp/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js\t/shop/a/b/c\t{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }\nTypeScript\n\nWhen using TypeScript, you can add types for params depending on your configured route segment — use PageProps<'/route'>, LayoutProps<'/route'>, or RouteContext<'/route'> to type params in page, layout, and route respectively.\n\nRoute params values are typed as string, string[], or undefined (for optional catch-all segments), because their values aren't known until runtime. Users can enter any URL into the address bar, and these broad types help ensure that your application code handles all these possible cases.\n\nRoute\tparams Type Definition\napp/blog/[slug]/page.js\t{ slug: string }\napp/shop/[...slug]/page.js\t{ slug: string[] }\napp/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js\t{ slug?: string[] }\napp/[categoryId]/[itemId]/page.js\t{ categoryId: string, itemId: string }\n\nIf you're working on a route where params can only have a fixed number of valid values, such as a [locale] param with a known set of language codes, you can use runtime validation to handle any invalid params a user may enter, and let the rest of your application work with the narrower type from your known set.\n\n/app/[locale]/page.tsx\nimport { notFound } from 'next/navigation'\nimport type { Locale } from '@i18n/types'\nimport { isValidLocale } from '@i18n/utils'\n \nfunction assertValidLocale(value: string): asserts value is Locale {\n  if (!isValidLocale(value)) notFound()\n}\n \nexport default async function Page(props: PageProps<'/[locale]'>) {\n  const { locale } = await props.params // locale is typed as string\n  assertValidLocale(locale)\n  // locale is now typed as Locale\n}\nBehavior\nSince the params prop is a promise. You must use async/await or React's use function to access the values.\nIn version 14 and earlier, params was a synchronous prop. To help with backwards compatibility, you can still access it synchronously in Next.js 15, but this behavior will be deprecated in the future.\nExamples\nWith generateStaticParams\n\nThe generateStaticParams function can be used to statically generate routes at build time instead of on-demand at request time.\n\napp/blog/[slug]/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json())\n \n  return posts.map((post) => ({\n    slug: post.slug,\n  }))\n}\n\nWhen using fetch inside the generateStaticParams function, the requests are automatically deduplicated. This avoids multiple network calls for the same data Layouts, Pages, and other generateStaticParams functions, speeding up build time.\n\nNext Steps\nFor more information on what to do next, we recommend the following sections\ngenerateStaticParams\nAPI reference for the generateStaticParams function.\nPrevious\ndefault.js\nNext\nerror.js\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

However, for hard navigations (full-page load), Next.js cannot recover the active state. In this case, a default.js file can be rendered for subpages that don't match the current URL.\n\nConsider the following folder structure. The @team slot has a settings page, but @analytics does not.\n\nWhen navigating to /settings, the @team slot will render the settings page while maintaining the currently active page for the @analytics slot.\n\nOn refresh, Next.js will render a default.js for @analytics. If default.js doesn't exist, an error is returned for named slots (@team, @analytics, etc) and requires you to define a default.js in order to continue. If you want to preserve the old behavior of returning a 404 in these situations, you can create a default.js that contains:\n\napp/@team/default.js\nimport { notFound } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function Default() {\n  notFound()\n}\n\nAdditionally, since children is an implicit slot, you also need to create a default.js file to render a fallback for children when Next.js cannot recover the active state of the parent page. If you don't create a default.js for the children slot, it will return a 404 page for the route.\n\nReference\nparams (optional)\n\nA promise that resolves to an object containing the dynamic route parameters from the root segment down to the slot's subpages.

However, this behavior is different in production to avoid leaking potentially sensitive details included in the error to the client.\n\nerror.message\nErrors forwarded from Client Components show the original Error message.\nErrors forwarded from Server Components show a generic message with an identifier. This is to prevent leaking sensitive details. You can use the identifier, under errors.digest, to match the corresponding server-side logs.\nerror.digest\n\nAn automatically generated hash of the error thrown. It can be used to match the corresponding error in server-side logs.\n\nreset\n\nThe cause of an error can sometimes be temporary. In these cases, trying again might resolve the issue.\n\nAn error component can use the reset() function to prompt the user to attempt to recover from the error. When executed, the function will try to re-render the error boundary's contents. If successful, the fallback error component is replaced with the result of the re-render.\n\napp/dashboard/error.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client' // Error boundaries must be Client Components\n \nexport default function Error({\n  error,\n  reset,\n}: {\n  error: Error & { digest?: string }\n  reset: () => void\n}) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>\n      <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nExamples\nGlobal Error\n\nWhile less common, you can handle errors in the root layout or template using global-error.jsx, located in the root app directory, even when leveraging internationalization. Global error UI must define its own <html> and <body> tags, global styles, fonts, or other dependencies that your error page requires. This file replaces the root layout or template when active.\n\nGood to know: Error boundaries must be Client Components, which means that metadata and generateMetadata exports are not supported in global-error.jsx. As an alternative, you can use the React <title>\n component.\n\napp/global-error.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client' // Error boundaries must be Client Components\n \nexport default function GlobalError({\n  error,\n  reset,\n}: {\n  error: Error & { digest?: string }\n  reset: () => void\n}) {\n  return (\n    // global-error must include html and body tags\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>\n        <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\nGraceful error recovery with a custom error boundary\n\nWhen rendering fails on the client, it can be useful to show the last known server rendered UI for a better user experience.\n\nThe GracefullyDegradingErrorBoundary is an example of a custom error boundary that captures and preserves the current HTML before an error occurs. If a rendering error happens, it re-renders the captured HTML and displays a persistent notification bar to inform the user.\n\napp/dashboard/error.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport React, { Component, ErrorInfo, ReactNode } from 'react'\n \ninterface ErrorBoundaryProps {\n  children: ReactNode\n  onError?: (error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) => void\n}\n \ninterface ErrorBoundaryState {\n  hasError: boolean\n}\n \nexport class GracefullyDegradingErrorBoundary extends Component<\n  ErrorBoundaryProps,\n  ErrorBoundaryState\n> {\n  private contentRef: React.RefObject<HTMLDivElement | null>\n \n  constructor(props: ErrorBoundaryProps) {\n    super(props)\n    this.state = { hasError: false }\n    this.contentRef = React.createRef()\n  }\n \n  static getDerivedStateFromError(_: Error): ErrorBoundaryState {\n    return { hasError: true }\n  }\n \n  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {\n    if (this.props.onError) {\n      this.props.onError(error, errorInfo)\n    }\n  }\n \n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      // Render the current HTML content without hydration\n      return (\n        <>\n          <div\n            ref={this.contentRef}\n            suppressHydrationWarning\n            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{\n              __html: this.contentRef.current?.innerHTML || '',\n            }}\n          />\n          <div className=\"fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-red-600 text-white py-4 px-6 text-center\">\n            <p className=\"font-semibold\">\n              An error occurred during page rendering\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </>\n      )\n    }\n \n    return <div ref={this.contentRef}>{this.props.children}</div>\n  }\n}\n \nexport default GracefullyDegradingErrorBoundary\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv15.2.0\tAlso display global-error in development.\nv13.1.0\tglobal-error introduced.\nv13.0.0\terror introduced.\nLearn more about error handling\nError Handling\nLearn how to display expected errors and handle uncaught exceptions.\nPrevious\nDynamic Segments\nNext\nforbidden.js\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

This prevents individual tracking failures from affecting other instrumentation features.\n\nRouter navigation tracking\n\nYou can export an onRouterTransitionStart function to receive notifications when navigation begins:\n\ninstrumentation-client.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nperformance.mark('app-init')\n \nexport function onRouterTransitionStart(\n  url: string,\n  navigationType: 'push' | 'replace' | 'traverse'\n) {\n  console.log(`Navigation started: ${navigationType} to ${url}`)\n  performance.mark(`nav-start-${Date.now()}`)\n}\n\nThe onRouterTransitionStart function receives two parameters:\n\nurl: string - The URL being navigated to\nnavigationType: 'push' | 'replace' | 'traverse' - The type of navigation\nPerformance considerations\n\nKeep instrumentation code lightweight.\n\nNext.js monitors initialization time in development and will log warnings if it takes longer than 16ms, which could impact smooth page loading.\n\nExecution timing\n\nThe instrumentation-client.js file executes at a specific point in the application lifecycle:\n\nAfter the HTML document is loaded\nBefore React hydration begins\nBefore user interactions are possible\n\nThis timing makes it ideal for setting up error tracking, analytics, and performance monitoring that needs to capture early application lifecycle events.\n\nExamples\nError tracking\n\nInitialize error tracking before React starts and add navigation breadcrumbs for better debugging context.\n\ninstrumentation-client.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Monitor from './lib/monitoring'\n \nMonitor.initialize()\n \nexport function onRouterTransitionStart(url: string) {\n  Monitor.pushEvent({\n    message: `Navigation to ${url}`,\n    category: 'navigation',\n  })\n}\nAnalytics tracking\n\nInitialize analytics and track navigation events with detailed metadata for user behavior analysis.\n\ninstrumentation-client.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { analytics } from './lib/analytics'\n \nanalytics.init()\n \nexport function onRouterTransitionStart(url: string, navigationType: string) {\n  analytics.track('page_navigation', {\n    url,\n    type: navigationType,\n    timestamp: Date.now(),\n  })\n}\nPerformance monitoring\n\nTrack Time to Interactive and navigation performance using the Performance Observer API and performance marks.\n\ninstrumentation-client.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nconst startTime = performance.now()\n \nconst observer = new PerformanceObserver(\n  (list: PerformanceObserverEntryList) => {\n    for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {\n      if (entry instanceof PerformanceNavigationTiming) {\n        console.log('Time to Interactive:', entry.loadEventEnd - startTime)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n)\n \nobserver.observe({ entryTypes: ['navigation'] })\n \nexport function onRouterTransitionStart(url: string) {\n  performance.mark(`nav-start-${url}`)\n}\nPolyfills\n\nLoad polyfills before application code runs. Use static imports for immediate loading and dynamic imports for conditional loading based on feature detection.\n\ninstrumentation-client.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport './lib/polyfills'\n \nif (!window.ResizeObserver) {\n  import('./lib/polyfills/resize-observer').then((mod) => {\n    window.ResizeObserver = mod.default\n  })\n}\nVersion history\nVersion\tChanges\nv15.3\tinstrumentation-client introduced\nPrevious\ninstrumentation.js\nNext\nIntercepting Routes\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

    "html": "API Reference\nFile-system conventions\nIntercepting Routes\nCopy page\nIntercepting Routes\n\nIntercepting routes allows you to load a route from another part of your application within the current layout. This routing paradigm can be useful when you want to display the content of a route without the user switching to a different context.\n\nFor example, when clicking on a photo in a feed, you can display the photo in a modal, overlaying the feed. In this case, Next.js intercepts the /photo/123 route, masks the URL, and overlays it over /feed.\n\nHowever, when navigating to the photo by clicking a shareable URL or by refreshing the page, the entire photo page should render instead of the modal. No route interception should occur.\n\nConvention\n\nIntercepting routes can be defined with the (..) convention, which is similar to relative path convention ../ but for route segments.\n\nYou can use:\n\n(.) to match segments on the same level\n(..) to match segments one level above\n(..)(..) to match segments two levels above\n(...) to match segments from the root app directory\n\nFor example, you can intercept the photo segment from within the feed segment by creating a (..)photo directory.\n\nGood to know: The (..) convention is based on route segments, not the file-system. For example, it does not consider @slot folders in Parallel Routes.\n\nExamples\nModals\n\nIntercepting Routes can be used together with Parallel Routes to create modals. This allows you to solve common challenges when building modals, such as:\n\nMaking the modal content shareable through a URL.\nPreserving context when the page is refreshed, instead of closing the modal.\nClosing the modal on backwards navigation rather than going to the previous route.\nReopening the modal on forwards navigation.\n\nConsider the following UI pattern, where a user can open a photo modal from a gallery using client-side navigation, or navigate to the photo page directly from a shareable URL:\n\nIn the above example, the path to the photo segment can use the (..) matcher since @modal is a slot and not a segment. This means that the photo route is only one segment level higher, despite being two file-system levels higher.\n\nSee the Parallel Routes documentation for a step-by-step example, or see our image gallery example\n.\n\nGood to know:\n\nOther examples could include opening a login modal in a top navbar while also having a dedicated /login page, or opening a shopping cart in a side modal.\nNext Steps\nLearn how to create modals with Intercepted and Parallel Routes.\nParallel Routes\nSimultaneously render one or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently.

It is used to define the <html> and <body> tags and other globally shared UI.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\nReference\nProps\nchildren (required)\n\nLayout components should accept and use a children prop. During rendering, children will be populated with the route segments the layout is wrapping. These will primarily be the component of a child Layout (if it exists) or Page, but could also be other special files like Loading or Error when applicable.\n\nparams (optional)\n\nA promise that resolves to an object containing the dynamic route parameters object from the root segment down to that layout.\n\napp/dashboard/[team]/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default async function Layout({\n  children,\n  params,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  params: Promise<{ team: string }>\n}) {\n  const { team } = await params\n}\nExample Route\tURL\tparams\napp/dashboard/[team]/layout.js\t/dashboard/1\tPromise<{ team: '1' }>\napp/shop/[tag]/[item]/layout.js\t/shop/1/2\tPromise<{ tag: '1', item: '2' }>\napp/blog/[...slug]/layout.js\t/blog/1/2\tPromise<{ slug: ['1', '2'] }>\nSince the params prop is a promise. You must use async/await or React's use\n function to access the values.\nIn version 14 and earlier, params was a synchronous prop. To help with backwards compatibility, you can still access it synchronously in Next.js 15, but this behavior will be deprecated in the future.\nLayout Props Helper\n\nYou can type layouts with LayoutProps to get a strongly typed params and named slots inferred from your directory structure. LayoutProps is a globally available helper.\n\napp/dashboard/layout.tsx\nexport default function Layout(props: LayoutProps<'/dashboard'>) {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      {props.children}\n      {/* If you have app/dashboard/@analytics, it appears as a typed slot: */}\n      {/* {props.analytics} */}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nTypes are generated during next dev, next build or next typegen.\nAfter type generation, the LayoutProps helper is globally available. It doesn't need to be imported.\nRoot Layout\n\nThe app directory must include a root layout, which is the top-most layout in the root app directory. Typically, the root layout is app/layout.js.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\nThe root layout must define <html> and <body> tags.\nYou should not manually add <head> tags such as <title> and <meta> to root layouts. Instead, you should use the Metadata API which automatically handles advanced requirements such as streaming and de-duplicating <head> elements.\nYou can use route groups to create multiple root layouts.\nNavigating across multiple root layouts will cause a full page load (as opposed to a client-side navigation). For example, navigating from /cart that uses app/(shop)/layout.js to /blog that uses app/(marketing)/layout.js will cause a full page load. This only applies to multiple root layouts.\nThe root layout can be under a dynamic segment, for example when implementing internationalization with app/[lang]/layout.js.\nCaveats\nRequest Object\n\nLayouts are cached in the client during navigation to avoid unnecessary server requests.\n\nLayouts do not rerender. They can be cached and reused to avoid unnecessary computation when navigating between pages. By restricting layouts from accessing the raw request, Next.js can prevent the execution of potentially slow or expensive user code within the layout, which could negatively impact performance.\n\nTo access the request object, you can use headers and cookies APIs in Server Components and Functions.\n\napp/shop/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport default async function Layout({ children }) {\n  const cookieStore = await cookies()\n  const theme = cookieStore.get('theme')\n  return '...'\n}\nQuery params\n\nLayouts do not rerender on navigation, so they cannot access search params which would otherwise become stale.\n\nTo access updated query parameters, you can use the Page searchParams prop, or read them inside a Client Component using the useSearchParams hook. Since Client Components re-render on navigation, they have access to the latest query parameters.\n\napp/ui/search.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function Search() {\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n \n  const search = searchParams.get('search')\n \n  return '...'\n}\napp/shop/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Search from '@/app/ui/search'\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Search />\n      {children}\n    </>\n  )\n}\nPathname\n\nLayouts do not re-render on navigation, so they do not access pathname which would otherwise become stale.\n\nTo access the current pathname, you can read it inside a Client Component using the usePathname hook. Since Client Components re-render during navigation, they have access to the latest pathname.\n\napp/ui/breadcrumbs.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'\n \n// Simplified breadcrumbs logic\nexport default function Breadcrumbs() {\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n  const segments = pathname.split('/')\n \n  return (\n    <nav>\n      {segments.map((segment, index) => (\n        <span key={index}>\n          {' > '}\n          {segment}\n        </span>\n      ))}\n    </nav>\n  )\n}\napp/docs/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { Breadcrumbs } from '@/app/ui/Breadcrumbs'\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Breadcrumbs />\n      <main>{children}</main>\n    </>\n  )\n}\nFetching Data\n\nLayouts cannot pass data to their children. However, you can fetch the same data in a route more than once, and use React cache\n to dedupe the requests without affecting performance.\n\nAlternatively, when using fetchin Next.js, requests are automatically deduped.\n\napp/lib/data.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport async function getUser(id: string) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../users/${id}`)\n  return res.json()\n}\napp/dashboard/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { getUser } from '@/app/lib/data'\nimport { UserName } from '@/app/ui/user-name'\n \nexport default async function Layout({ children }) {\n  const user = await getUser('1')\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        {/* ... */}\n        <UserName user={user.name} />\n      </nav>\n      {children}\n    </>\n  )\n}\napp/dashboard/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { getUser } from '@/app/lib/data'\nimport { UserName } from '@/app/ui/user-name'\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  const user = await getUser('1')\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome {user.name}</h1>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nAccessing child segments\n\nLayouts do not have access to the route segments below itself. To access all route segments, you can use useSelectedLayoutSegment or useSelectedLayoutSegments in a Client Component.\n\napp/ui/nav-link.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport { useSelectedLayoutSegment } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function NavLink({\n  slug,\n  children,\n}: {\n  slug: string\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  const segment = useSelectedLayoutSegment()\n  const isActive = slug === segment\n \n  return (\n    <Link\n      href={`/blog/${slug}`}\n      // Change style depending on whether the link is active\n      style={{ fontWeight: isActive ? 'bold' : 'normal' }}\n    >\n      {children}\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\napp/blog/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { NavLink } from './nav-link'\nimport getPosts from './get-posts'\n \nexport default async function Layout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  const featuredPosts = await getPosts()\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {featuredPosts.map((post) => (\n        <div key={post.id}>\n          <NavLink slug={post.slug}>{post.title}</NavLink>\n        </div>\n      ))}\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\nExamples\nMetadata\n\nYou can modify the <head> HTML elements such as title and meta using the metadata object or generateMetadata function.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'Next.js',\n}\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return '...'\n}\n\nGood to know: You should not manually add <head> tags such as <title> and <meta> to root layouts. Instead, use the Metadata APIs which automatically handles advanced requirements such as streaming and de-duplicating <head> elements.\n\nActive Nav Links\n\nYou can use the usePathname hook to determine if a nav link is active.\n\nSince usePathname is a client hook, you need to extract the nav links into a Client Component, which can be imported into your layout:\n\napp/ui/nav-links.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport function NavLinks() {\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n \n  return (\n    <nav>\n      <Link className={`link ${pathname === '/' ? 'active' : ''}`} href=\"/\">\n        Home\n      </Link>\n \n      <Link\n        className={`link ${pathname === '/about' ? 'active' : ''}`}\n        href=\"/about\"\n      >\n        About\n      </Link>\n    </nav>\n  )\n}\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { NavLinks } from '@/app/ui/nav-links'\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <NavLinks />\n        <main>{children}</main>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\nDisplaying content based on params\n\nUsing dynamic route segments, you can display or fetch specific content based on the params prop.\n\napp/dashboard/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default async function DashboardLayout({\n  children,\n  params,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  params: Promise<{ team: string }>\n}) {\n  const { team } = await params\n \n  return (\n    <section>\n      <header>\n        <h1>Welcome to {team}'s Dashboard</h1>\n      </header>\n      <main>{children}</main>\n    </section>\n  )\n}\nReading params in Client Components\n\nTo use params in a Client Component (which cannot be async), you can use React's use\n function to read the promise:\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { use } from 'react'\n \nexport default function Page({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>\n}) {\n  const { slug } = use(params)\n}\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv15.0.0-RC\tparams is now a promise.

    "html": "API Reference\nFile-system conventions\nloading.js\nCopy page\nloading.js\n\nThe special file loading.js helps you create meaningful Loading UI with React Suspense\n. With this convention, you can show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment streams in. The new content is automatically swapped in once complete.\n\napp/feed/loading.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default function Loading() {\n  // Or a custom loading skeleton component\n  return <p>Loading...</p>\n}\n\nInside the loading.js file, you can add any light-weight loading UI. You may find it helpful to use the React Developer Tools\n to manually toggle Suspense boundaries.\n\nBy default, this file is a Server Component - but can also be used as a Client Component through the \"use client\" directive.\n\nReference\nParameters\n\nLoading UI components do not accept any parameters.\n\nBehavior\nNavigation\nThe Fallback UI is prefetched, making navigation immediate unless prefetching hasn't completed.\nNavigation is interruptible, meaning changing routes does not need to wait for the content of the route to fully load before navigating to another route.\nShared layouts remain interactive while new route segments load.\nInstant Loading States\n\nAn instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately upon navigation. You can pre-render loading indicators such as skeletons and spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover photo, title, etc. This helps users understand the app is responding and provides a better user experience.\n\nCreate a loading state by adding a loading.js file inside a folder.\n\napp/dashboard/loading.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default function Loading() {\n  // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton.\n  return <LoadingSkeleton />\n}\n\nIn the same folder, loading.js will be nested inside layout.js. It will automatically wrap the page.js file and any children below in a <Suspense> boundary.\n\nSEO\nFor bots that only scrape static HTML, and cannot execute JavaScript like a full browser, such as Twitterbot, Next.js resolves generateMetadata before streaming UI, and metadata is placed in the <head> of the initial HTML.\nOtherwise, streaming metadata may be used used. Next.js automatically detects user agents to choose between blocking and streaming behavior.\nSince streaming is server-rendered, it does not impact SEO. You can use the Rich Results Test\n tool from Google to see how your page appears to Google's web crawlers and view the serialized HTML (source\n).\nStatus Codes\n\nWhen streaming, a 200 status code will be returned to signal that the request was successful.\n\nThe server can still communicate errors or issues to the client within the streamed content itself, for example, when using redirect or notFound. Because the response headers have already been sent to the client, the status code of the response cannot be updated.\n\nFor example, when a 404 page is streamed to the client, Next.js includes a <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\"> tag in the streamed HTML. This prevents search engines from indexing that URL even if the HTTP status is 200. See Google’s guidance on the robots meta tag\n.\n\nSome crawlers may label these responses as “soft 404s”. In the streaming case, this does not lead to indexation because the page is explicitly marked noindex in the HTML.\n\nIf you need a 404 status, for compliance or analytics, ensure the resource exists before the response body is streamed, so that the server can set the HTTP status code.\n\nYou can run this check in proxy to rewrite missing slugs to a not-found route, or produce a 404 response. Keep proxy checks fast, and avoid fetching full content there.\n\nWhen is the response body streamed?\nBrowser limits\n\nSome browsers\n buffer a streaming response. You may not see the streamed response until the response exceeds 1024 bytes. This typically only affects “hello world” applications, but not real applications.\n\nPlatform Support\nDeployment Option\tSupported\nNode.js server\tYes\nDocker container\tYes\nStatic export\tNo\nAdapters\tPlatform-specific\n\nLearn how to configure streaming when self-hosting Next.js.\n\nExamples\nStreaming with Suspense\n\nIn addition to loading.js, you can also manually create Suspense Boundaries for your own UI components. The App Router supports streaming with Suspense\n.\n\n<Suspense> works by wrapping a component that performs an asynchronous action (e.g. fetch data), showing fallback UI (e.g. skeleton, spinner) while it's happening, and then swapping in your component once the action completes.\n\napp/dashboard/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport { PostFeed, Weather } from './Components'\n \nexport default function Posts() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>\n        <PostFeed />\n      </Suspense>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>\n        <Weather />\n      </Suspense>\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nBy using Suspense, you get the benefits of:\n\nStreaming Server Rendering - Progressively rendering HTML from the server to the client.\nSelective Hydration - React prioritizes what components to make interactive first based on user interaction.\n\nFor more Suspense examples and use cases, please see the React Documentation\n.\n\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv13.0.0\tloading introduced.\nPrevious\nlayout.js\nNext\nmdx-components.js\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

This can happen in two cases:\n\nYour app has multiple root layouts (e.g. app/(admin)/layout.tsx and app/(shop)/layout.tsx), so there's no single layout to compose a global 404 from.\nYour root layout is defined using top-level dynamic segments (e.g. app/[country]/layout.tsx), which makes composing a consistent 404 page harder.\n\nTo enable it, add the globalNotFound flag in next.config.ts:\n\nnext.config.ts\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  experimental: {\n    globalNotFound: true,\n  },\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nThen, create a file in the root of the app directory: app/global-not-found.js:\n\napp/global-not-found.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n// Import global styles and fonts\nimport './globals.css'\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: '404 - Page Not Found',\n  description: 'The page you are looking for does not exist.',\n}\n \nexport default function GlobalNotFound() {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={inter.className}>\n      <body>\n        <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>\n        <p>This page does not exist.</p>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n\nUnlike not-found.js, this file must return a full HTML document, including <html> and <body> tags.\n\nReference\nProps\n\nnot-found.js or global-not-found.js components do not accept any props.\n\nGood to know: In addition to catching expected notFound() errors, the root app/not-found.js and app/global-not-found.js files handle any unmatched URLs for your whole application. This means users that visit a URL that is not handled by your app will be shown the exported UI.\n\nExamples\nData Fetching\n\nBy default, not-found is a Server Component. You can mark it as async to fetch and display data:\n\napp/not-found.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport default async function NotFound() {\n  const headersList = await headers()\n  const domain = headersList.get('host')\n  const data = await getSiteData(domain)\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Not Found: {data.name}</h2>\n      <p>Could not find requested resource</p>\n      <p>\n        View <Link href=\"/blog\">all posts</Link>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nIf you need to use Client Component hooks like usePathname to display content based on the path, you must fetch data on the client-side instead.\n\nMetadata\n\nFor global-not-found.js, you can export a metadata object or a generateMetadata function to customize the <title>, <meta>, and other head tags for your 404 page:\n\nGood to know: Next.js automatically injects <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\" /> for pages that return a 404 status code, including global-not-found.js pages.\n\napp/global-not-found.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'Not Found',\n  description: 'The page you are looking for does not exist.',\n}\n \nexport default function GlobalNotFound() {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <div>\n          <h1>Not Found</h1>\n          <p>The page you are looking for does not exist.</p>\n        </div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv15.4.0\tglobal-not-found.js introduced (experimental).\nv13.3.0\tRoot app/not-found handles global unmatched URLs.\nv13.0.0\tnot-found introduced.\nPrevious\nmdx-components.js\nNext\npage.js\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

    "url": "https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/parallel-routes",
    "html": "API Reference\nFile-system conventions\nParallel Routes\nCopy page\nParallel Routes\n\nParallel Routes allows you to simultaneously or conditionally render one or more pages within the same layout. They are useful for highly dynamic sections of an app, such as dashboards and feeds on social sites.\n\nFor example, considering a dashboard, you can use parallel routes to simultaneously render the team and analytics pages:\n\nConvention\nSlots\n\nParallel routes are created using named slots. Slots are defined with the @folder convention. For example, the following file structure defines two slots: @analytics and @team:\n\nSlots are passed as props to the shared parent layout. For the example above, the component in app/layout.js now accepts the @analytics and @team slots props, and can render them in parallel alongside the children prop:\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default function Layout({\n  children,\n  team,\n  analytics,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n  analytics: React.ReactNode\n  team: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      {children}\n      {team}\n      {analytics}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nHowever, slots are not route segments and do not affect the URL structure. For example, for /@analytics/views, the URL will be /views since @analytics is a slot. Slots are combined with the regular Page component to form the final page associated with the route segment. Because of this, you cannot have separate static and dynamic slots at the same route segment level. If one slot is dynamic, all slots at that level must be dynamic.\n\nGood to know:\n\nThe children prop is an implicit slot that does not need to be mapped to a folder. This means app/page.js is equivalent to app/@children/page.js.\ndefault.js\n\nYou can define a default.js file to render as a fallback for unmatched slots during the initial load or full-page reload.\n\nConsider the following folder structure. The @team slot has a /settings page, but @analytics does not.\n\nWhen navigating to /settings, the @team slot will render the /settings page while maintaining the currently active page for the @analytics slot.\n\nOn refresh, Next.js will render a default.js for @analytics. If default.js doesn't exist, a 404 is rendered instead.\n\nAdditionally, since children is an implicit slot, you also need to create a default.js file to render a fallback for children when Next.js cannot recover the active state of the parent page.\n\nBehavior\n\nBy default, Next.js keeps track of the active state (or subpage) for each slot. However, the content rendered within a slot will depend on the type of navigation:\n\nSoft Navigation: During client-side navigation, Next.js will perform a partial render, changing the subpage within the slot, while maintaining the other slot's active subpages, even if they don't match the current URL.\nHard Navigation: After a full-page load (browser refresh), Next.js cannot determine the active state for the slots that don't match the current URL. Instead, it will render a default.js file for the unmatched slots, or 404 if default.js doesn't exist.\n\nGood to know:\n\nThe 404 for unmatched routes helps ensure that you don't accidentally render a parallel route on a page that it was not intended for.\nExamples\nWith useSelectedLayoutSegment(s)\n\nBoth useSelectedLayoutSegment and useSelectedLayoutSegments accept a parallelRoutesKey parameter, which allows you to read the active route segment within a slot.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { useSelectedLayoutSegment } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function Layout({ auth }: { auth: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const loginSegment = useSelectedLayoutSegment('auth')\n  // ...\n}\n\nWhen a user navigates to app/@auth/login (or /login in the URL bar), loginSegment will be equal to the string \"login\".\n\nConditional Routes\n\nYou can use Parallel Routes to conditionally render routes based on certain conditions, such as user role. For example, to render a different dashboard page for the /admin or /user roles:\n\napp/dashboard/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { checkUserRole } from '@/lib/auth'\n \nexport default function Layout({\n  user,\n  admin,\n}: {\n  user: React.ReactNode\n  admin: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  const role = checkUserRole()\n  return role === 'admin' ? admin : user\n}\nTab Groups\n\nYou can add a layout inside a slot to allow users to navigate the slot independently. This is useful for creating tabs.\n\nFor example, the @analytics slot has two subpages: /page-views and /visitors.\n\nWithin @analytics, create a layout file to share the tabs between the two pages:\n\napp/@analytics/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Link href=\"/page-views\">Page Views</Link>\n        <Link href=\"/visitors\">Visitors</Link>\n      </nav>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\nModals\n\nParallel Routes can be used together with Intercepting Routes to create modals that support deep linking. This allows you to solve common challenges when building modals, such as:\n\nMaking the modal content shareable through a URL.\nPreserving context when the page is refreshed, instead of closing the modal.\nClosing the modal on backwards navigation rather than going to the previous route.\nReopening the modal on forwards navigation.\n\nConsider the following UI pattern, where a user can open a login modal from a layout using client-side navigation, or access a separate /login page:\n\nTo implement this pattern, start by creating a /login route that renders your main login page.\n\napp/login/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { Login } from '@/app/ui/login'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Login />\n}\n\nThen, inside the @auth slot, add default.js file that returns null. This ensures that the modal is not rendered when it's not active.\n\napp/@auth/default.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default function Default() {\n  return null\n}\n\nInside your @auth slot, intercept the /login route by importing the <Modal> component and its children into the @auth/(.)login/page.tsx file, and updating the folder name to /@auth/(.)login/page.tsx.\n\napp/@auth/(.)login/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { Modal } from '@/app/ui/modal'\nimport { Login } from '@/app/ui/login'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Modal>\n      <Login />\n    </Modal>\n  )\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nThe convention (.) is used for intercepting routes. See Intercepting Routes docs for more information.\nBy separating the <Modal> functionality from the modal content (<Login>), you can ensure any content inside the modal, e.g. forms, are Server Components. See Interleaving Client and Server Components for more information.\nOpening the modal\n\nNow, you can leverage the Next.js router to open and close the modal. This ensures the URL is correctly updated when the modal is open, and when navigating backwards and forwards.\n\nTo open the modal, pass the @auth slot as a prop to the parent layout and render it alongside the children prop.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Layout({\n  auth,\n  children,\n}: {\n  auth: React.ReactNode\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Link href=\"/login\">Open modal</Link>\n      </nav>\n      <div>{auth}</div>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nWhen the user clicks the <Link>, the modal will open instead of navigating to the /login page. However, on refresh or initial load, navigating to /login will take the user to the main login page.\n\nClosing the modal\n\nYou can close the modal by calling router.back() or by using the Link component.\n\napp/ui/modal.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          router.back()\n        }}\n      >\n        Close modal\n      </button>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nWhen using the Link component to navigate away from a page that shouldn't render the @auth slot anymore, we need to make sure the parallel route matches to a component that returns null. For example, when navigating back to the root page, we create a @auth/page.tsx component:\n\napp/ui/modal.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport function Modal({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Close modal</Link>\n      <div>{children}</div>\n    </>\n  )\n}\napp/@auth/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default function Page() {\n  return null\n}\n\nOr if navigating to any other page (such as /foo, /foo/bar, etc), you can use a catch-all slot:\n\napp/@auth/[...catchAll]/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default function CatchAll() {\n  return null\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nWe use a catch-all route in our @auth slot to close the modal because of how parallel routes behave. Since client-side navigations to a route that no longer match the slot will remain visible, we need to match the slot to a route that returns null to close the modal.\nOther examples could include opening a photo modal in a gallery while also having a dedicated /photo/[id] page, or opening a shopping cart in a side modal.\nView an example\n of modals with Intercepted and Parallel Routes.\nLoading and Error UI\n\nParallel Routes can be streamed independently, allowing you to define independent error and loading states for each route:\n\nSee the Loading UI and Error Handling documentation for more information.\n\nNext Steps\ndefault.js\nAPI Reference for the default.js file.\nPrevious\npage.js\nNext\nproxy.js\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

See Migration to Proxy for more details.\n\nThe proxy.js|ts file is used to write Proxy and run code on the server before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.\n\nProxy executes before routes are rendered. It's particularly useful for implementing custom server-side logic like authentication, logging, or handling redirects.\n\nGood to know:\n\nProxy is meant to be invoked separately of your render code and in optimized cases deployed to your CDN for fast redirect/rewrite handling, you should not attempt relying on shared modules or globals.\n\nTo pass information from Proxy to your application, use headers, cookies, rewrites, redirects, or the URL.\n\nCreate a proxy.ts (or .js) file in the project root, or inside src if applicable, so that it is located at the same level as pages or app.\n\nIf you’ve customized pageExtensions, for example to .page.ts or .page.js, name your file proxy.page.ts or proxy.page.js accordingly.\n\nproxy.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \n// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside\nexport function proxy(request: NextRequest) {\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*',\n}\nExports\nProxy function\n\nThe file must export a single function, either as a default export or named proxy. Note that multiple proxy from the same file are not supported.\n\nproxy.js\n// Example of default export\nexport default function proxy(request) {\n  // Proxy logic\n}\nConfig object (optional)\n\nOptionally, a config object can be exported alongside the Proxy function. This object includes the matcher to specify paths where the Proxy applies.\n\nMatcher\n\nThe matcher option allows you to target specific paths for the Proxy to run on. You can specify these paths in several ways:\n\nFor a single path: Directly use a string to define the path, like '/about'.\nFor multiple paths: Use an array to list multiple paths, such as matcher: ['/about', '/contact'], which applies the Proxy to both /about and /contact.\nproxy.js\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/about/:path*', '/dashboard/:path*'],\n}\n\nAdditionally, the matcher option supports complex path specifications through regular expressions, such as matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\\\.png$).*)'], enabling precise control over which paths to include or exclude.\n\nThe matcher option accepts an array of objects with the following keys:\n\nsource: The path or pattern used to match the request paths. It can be a string for direct path matching or a pattern for more complex matching.\nregexp (optional): A regular expression string that fine-tunes the matching based on the source. It provides additional control over which paths are included or excluded.\nlocale (optional): A boolean that, when set to false, ignores locale-based routing in path matching.\nhas (optional): Specifies conditions based on the presence of specific request elements such as headers, query parameters, or cookies.\nmissing (optional): Focuses on conditions where certain request elements are absent, like missing headers or cookies.\nproxy.js\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    {\n      source: '/api/*',\n      regexp: '^/api/(.*)',\n      locale: false,\n      has: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'Authorization', value: 'Bearer Token' },\n        { type: 'query', key: 'userId', value: '123' },\n      ],\n      missing: [{ type: 'cookie', key: 'session', value: 'active' }],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n\nConfigured matchers:\n\nMUST start with /\nCan include named parameters: /about/:path matches /about/a and /about/b but not /about/a/c\nCan have modifiers on named parameters (starting with :): /about/:path* matches /about/a/b/c because * is zero or more. ? is zero or one and + one or more\nCan use regular expression enclosed in parenthesis: /about/(.*) is the same as /about/:path*\n\nRead more details on path-to-regexp\n documentation.\n\nGood to know:\n\nThe matcher values need to be constants so they can be statically analyzed at build-time. Dynamic values such as variables will be ignored.\nFor backward compatibility, Next.js always considers /public as /public/index. Therefore, a matcher of /public/:path will match.\nParams\nrequest\n\nWhen defining Proxy, the default export function accepts a single parameter, request. This parameter is an instance of NextRequest, which represents the incoming HTTP request.\n\nproxy.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function proxy(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Proxy logic goes here\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nNextRequest is a type that represents incoming HTTP requests in Next.js Proxy, whereas NextResponse is a class used to manipulate and send back HTTP responses.\nNextResponse\n\nThe NextResponse API allows you to:\n\nredirect the incoming request to a different URL\nrewrite the response by displaying a given URL\nSet request headers for API Routes, getServerSideProps, and rewrite destinations\nSet response cookies\nSet response headers\n\nTo produce a response from Proxy, you can:\n\nrewrite to a route (Page or Route Handler) that produces a response\nreturn a NextResponse directly. See Producing a Response\n\nGood to know: For redirects, you can also use Response.redirect instead of NextResponse.redirect.\n\nExecution order\n\nProxy will be invoked for every route in your project. Given this, it's crucial to use matchers to precisely target or exclude specific routes. The following is the execution order:\n\nheaders from next.config.js\nredirects from next.config.js\nProxy (rewrites, redirects, etc.)\nbeforeFiles (rewrites) from next.config.js\nFilesystem routes (public/, _next/static/, pages/, app/, etc.)\nafterFiles (rewrites) from next.config.js\nDynamic Routes (/blog/[slug])\nfallback (rewrites) from next.config.js\nRuntime\n\nProxy defaults to using the Node.js runtime. The runtime config option is not available in Proxy files. Setting the runtime config option in Proxy will throw an error.\n\nAdvanced Proxy flags\n\nIn v13.1 of Next.js two additional flags were introduced for proxy, skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize and skipTrailingSlashRedirect to handle advanced use cases.\n\nskipTrailingSlashRedirect disables Next.js redirects for adding or removing trailing slashes. This allows custom handling inside proxy to maintain the trailing slash for some paths but not others, which can make incremental migrations easier.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true,\n}\nproxy.js\nconst legacyPrefixes = ['/docs', '/blog']\n \nexport default async function proxy(req) {\n  const { pathname } = req.nextUrl\n \n  if (legacyPrefixes.some((prefix) => pathname.startsWith(prefix))) {\n    return NextResponse.next()\n  }\n \n  // apply trailing slash handling\n  if (\n    !pathname.endsWith('/') &&\n    !pathname.match(/((?!\\.well-known(?:\\/.*)?)(?:[^/]+\\/)*[^/]+\\.\\w+)/)\n  ) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(\n      new URL(`${req.nextUrl.pathname}/`, req.nextUrl)\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nskipMiddlewareUrlNormalize allows for disabling the URL normalization in Next.js to make handling direct visits and client-transitions the same. In some advanced cases, this option provides full control by using the original URL.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize: true,\n}\nproxy.js\nexport default async function proxy(req) {\n  const { pathname } = req.nextUrl\n \n  // GET /_next/data/build-id/hello.json\n \n  console.log(pathname)\n  // with the flag this now /_next/data/build-id/hello.json\n  // without the flag this would be normalized to /hello\n}\nExamples\nConditional Statements\nproxy.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function proxy(request: NextRequest) {\n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/about')) {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/about-2', request.url))\n  }\n \n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/dashboard/user', request.url))\n  }\n}\nUsing Cookies\n\nCookies are regular headers. On a Request, they are stored in the Cookie header. On a Response they are in the Set-Cookie header. Next.js provides a convenient way to access and manipulate these cookies through the cookies extension on NextRequest and NextResponse.\n\nFor incoming requests, cookies comes with the following methods: get, getAll, set, and delete cookies. You can check for the existence of a cookie with has or remove all cookies with clear.\nFor outgoing responses, cookies have the following methods get, getAll, set, and delete.\nproxy.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function proxy(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Assume a \"Cookie:nextjs=fast\" header to be present on the incoming request\n  // Getting cookies from the request using the `RequestCookies` API\n  let cookie = request.cookies.get('nextjs')\n  console.log(cookie) // => { name: 'nextjs', value: 'fast', Path: '/' }\n  const allCookies = request.cookies.getAll()\n  console.log(allCookies) // => [{ name: 'nextjs', value: 'fast' }]\n \n  request.cookies.has('nextjs') // => true\n  request.cookies.delete('nextjs')\n  request.cookies.has('nextjs') // => false\n \n  // Setting cookies on the response using the `ResponseCookies` API\n  const response = NextResponse.next()\n  response.cookies.set('vercel', 'fast')\n  response.cookies.set({\n    name: 'vercel',\n    value: 'fast',\n    path: '/',\n  })\n  cookie = response.cookies.get('vercel')\n  console.log(cookie) // => { name: 'vercel', value: 'fast', Path: '/' }\n  // The outgoing response will have a `Set-Cookie:vercel=fast;path=/` header.\n \n  return response\n}\nSetting Headers\n\nYou can set request and response headers using the NextResponse API (setting request headers is available since Next.js v13.0.0).\n\nproxy.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function proxy(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Clone the request headers and set a new header `x-hello-from-proxy1`\n  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)\n  requestHeaders.set('x-hello-from-proxy1', 'hello')\n \n  // You can also set request headers in NextResponse.next\n  const response = NextResponse.next({\n    request: {\n      // New request headers\n      headers: requestHeaders,\n    },\n  })\n \n  // Set a new response header `x-hello-from-proxy2`\n  response.headers.set('x-hello-from-proxy2', 'hello')\n  return response\n}\n\nNote that the snippet uses:\n\nNextResponse.next({ request: { headers: requestHeaders } }) to make requestHeaders available upstream\nNOT NextResponse.next({ headers: requestHeaders }) which makes requestHeaders available to clients\n\nLearn more in NextResponse headers in Proxy.\n\nGood to know: Avoid setting large headers as it might cause 431 Request Header Fields Too Large\n error depending on your backend web server configuration.\n\nCORS\n\nYou can set CORS headers in Proxy to allow cross-origin requests, including simple\n and preflighted\n requests.\n\nproxy.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nconst allowedOrigins = ['https://acme.com', 'https://my-app.org']\n \nconst corsOptions = {\n  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS',\n  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',\n}\n \nexport function proxy(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Check the origin from the request\n  const origin = request.headers.get('origin') ?? ''\n  const isAllowedOrigin = allowedOrigins.includes(origin)\n \n  // Handle preflighted requests\n  const isPreflight = request.method === 'OPTIONS'\n \n  if (isPreflight) {\n    const preflightHeaders = {\n      ...(isAllowedOrigin && { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': origin }),\n      ...corsOptions,\n    }\n    return NextResponse.json({}, { headers: preflightHeaders })\n  }\n \n  // Handle simple requests\n  const response = NextResponse.next()\n \n  if (isAllowedOrigin) {\n    response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin)\n  }\n \n  Object.entries(corsOptions).forEach(([key, value]) => {\n    response.headers.set(key, value)\n  })\n \n  return response\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/api/:path*',\n}\n\nGood to know: You can configure CORS headers for individual routes in Route Handlers.\n\nProducing a response\n\nYou can respond from Proxy directly by returning a Response or NextResponse instance. (This is available since Next.js v13.1.0\n)\n\nproxy.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { isAuthenticated } from '@lib/auth'\n \n// Limit the proxy to paths starting with `/api/`\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/api/:function*',\n}\n \nexport function proxy(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Call our authentication function to check the request\n  if (!isAuthenticated(request)) {\n    // Respond with JSON indicating an error message\n    return Response.json(\n      { success: false, message: 'authentication failed' },\n      { status: 401 }\n    )\n  }\n}\nNegative matching\n\nThe matcher config allows full regex so matching like negative lookaheads or character matching is supported. An example of a negative lookahead to match all except specific paths can be seen here:\n\nproxy.js\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - _next/image (image optimization files)\n     * - favicon.ico, sitemap.xml, robots.txt (metadata files)\n     */\n    '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|sitemap.xml|robots.txt).*)',\n  ],\n}\n\nYou can also bypass Proxy for certain requests by using the missing or has arrays, or a combination of both:\n\nproxy.js\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - _next/image (image optimization files)\n     * - favicon.ico, sitemap.xml, robots.txt (metadata files)\n     */\n    {\n      source:\n        '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|sitemap.xml|robots.txt).*)',\n      missing: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },\n        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },\n      ],\n    },\n \n    {\n      source:\n        '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|sitemap.xml|robots.txt).*)',\n      has: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },\n        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },\n      ],\n    },\n \n    {\n      source:\n        '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|sitemap.xml|robots.txt).*)',\n      has: [{ type: 'header', key: 'x-present' }],\n      missing: [{ type: 'header', key: 'x-missing', value: 'prefetch' }],\n    },\n  ],\n}\nwaitUntil and NextFetchEvent\n\nThe NextFetchEvent object extends the native FetchEvent\n object, and includes the waitUntil()\n method.\n\nThe waitUntil() method takes a promise as an argument, and extends the lifetime of the Proxy until the promise settles. This is useful for performing work in the background.\n\nproxy.ts\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextFetchEvent, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function proxy(req: NextRequest, event: NextFetchEvent) {\n  event.waitUntil(\n    fetch('https://my-analytics-platform.com', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      body: JSON.stringify({ pathname: req.nextUrl.pathname }),\n    })\n  )\n \n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\nUnit testing (experimental)\n\nStarting in Next.js 15.1, the next/experimental/testing/server package contains utilities to help unit test proxy files. Unit testing proxy can help ensure that it's only run on desired paths and that custom routing logic works as intended before code reaches production.\n\nThe unstable_doesProxyMatch function can be used to assert whether proxy will run for the provided URL, headers, and cookies.\n\nimport { unstable_doesProxyMatch } from 'next/experimental/testing/server'\n \nexpect(\n  unstable_doesProxyMatch({\n    config,\n    nextConfig,\n    url: '/test',\n  })\n).toEqual(false)\n\nThe entire proxy function can also be tested.\n\nimport { isRewrite, getRewrittenUrl } from 'next/experimental/testing/server'\n \nconst request = new NextRequest('https://nextjs.org/docs')\nconst response = await proxy(request)\nexpect(isRewrite(response)).toEqual(true)\nexpect(getRewrittenUrl(response)).toEqual('https://other-domain.com/docs')\n// getRedirectUrl could also be used if the response were a redirect\nPlatform support\nDeployment Option\tSupported\nNode.js server\tYes\nDocker container\tYes\nStatic export\tNo\nAdapters\tPlatform-specific\n\nLearn how to configure Proxy when self-hosting Next.js.\n\nMigration to Proxy\nWhy the Change\n\nThe reason behind the renaming of middleware is that the term \"middleware\" can often be confused with Express.js middleware, leading to a misinterpretation of its purpose. Also, Middleware is highly capable, so it may encourage the usage; however, this feature is recommended to be used as a last resort.\n\nNext.js is moving forward to provide better APIs with better ergonomics so that developers can achieve their goals without Middleware. This is the reason behind the renaming of middleware.\n\nWhy \"Proxy\"\n\nThe name Proxy clarifies what Middleware is capable of. The term \"proxy\" implies that it has a network boundary in front of the app, which is the behavior of Middleware. Also, Middleware defaults to run at the Edge Runtime, which can run closer to the client, separated from the app's region. These behaviors align better with the term \"proxy\" and provide a clearer purpose of the feature.\n\nHow to Migrate\n\nWe recommend users avoid relying on Middleware unless no other options exist. Our goal is to give them APIs with better ergonomics so they can achieve their goals without Middleware.\n\nThe term “middleware” often confuses users with Express.js middleware, which can encourage misuse. To clarify our direction, we are renaming the file convention to “proxy.” This highlights that we are moving away from Middleware, breaking down its overloaded features, and making the Proxy clear in its purpose.\n\nNext.js provides a codemod to migrate from middleware.ts to proxy.ts. You can run the following command to migrate:\n\nnpx @next/codemod@canary middleware-to-proxy .\n\nThe codemod will rename the file and the function name from middleware to proxy.\n\n// middleware.ts -> proxy.ts\n \n- export function middleware() {\n+ export function proxy() {\nVersion history\nVersion\tChanges\nv16.0.0\tMiddleware is deprecated and renamed to Proxy\nv15.5.0\tMiddleware can now use the Node.js runtime (stable)\nv15.2.0\tMiddleware can now use the Node.js runtime (experimental)\nv13.1.0\tAdvanced Middleware flags added\nv13.0.0\tMiddleware can modify request headers, response headers, and send responses\nv12.2.0\tMiddleware is stable, please see the upgrade guide\nv12.0.9\tEnforce absolute URLs in Edge Runtime (PR\n)\nv12.0.0\tMiddleware (Beta) added\nLearn more about Proxy\nNextRequest\nAPI Reference for NextRequest.\nNextResponse\nAPI Reference for NextResponse.\nPrevious\nParallel Routes\nNext\npublic\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

Files inside public can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).\n\nFor example, the file public/avatars/me.png can be viewed by visiting the /avatars/me.png path. The code to display that image might look like:\n\navatar.js\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport function Avatar({ id, alt }) {\n  return <Image src={`/avatars/${id}.png`} alt={alt} width=\"64\" height=\"64\" />\n}\n \nexport function AvatarOfMe() {\n  return <Avatar id=\"me\" alt=\"A portrait of me\" />\n}\nCaching\n\nNext.js cannot safely cache assets in the public folder because they may change.

Note that sitemap.xml, robots.txt, app icons, and open graph images all have built-in support.\n\napp/rss.xml/route.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport async function GET() {\n  return new Response(\n    `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n<rss version=\"2.0\">\n \n<channel>\n  <title>Next.js Documentation</title>\n  <link>https://nextjs.org/docs</link>\n  <description>The React Framework for the Web</description>\n</channel>\n \n</rss>`,\n    {\n      headers: {\n        'Content-Type': 'text/xml',\n      },\n    }\n  )\n}\nSegment Config Options\n\nRoute Handlers use the same route segment configuration as pages and layouts.\n\napp/items/route.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport const dynamic = 'auto'\nexport const dynamicParams = true\nexport const revalidate = false\nexport const fetchCache = 'auto'\nexport const runtime = 'nodejs'\nexport const preferredRegion = 'auto'\n\nSee the API reference for more details.\n\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv15.0.0-RC\tcontext.params is now a promise.

The dynamic option is a way to opt back in to the previous model as a convenience and provides a simpler migration path.\n\n'auto' (default): The default option to cache as much as possible without preventing any components from opting into dynamic behavior.\n\n'force-dynamic': Force dynamic rendering, which will result in routes being rendered for each user at request time. This option is equivalent to:\n\nSetting the option of every fetch() request in a layout or page to { cache: 'no-store', next: { revalidate: 0 } }.\nSetting the segment config to export const fetchCache = 'force-no-store'\n\n'error': Force static rendering and cache the data of a layout or page by causing an error if any components use Dynamic APIs or uncached data. This option is equivalent to:\n\ngetStaticProps() in the pages directory.\nSetting the option of every fetch() request in a layout or page to { cache: 'force-cache' }.\nSetting the segment config to fetchCache = 'only-cache'.\n\n'force-static': Force static rendering and cache the data of a layout or page by forcing cookies, headers() and useSearchParams() to return empty values. It is possible to revalidate, revalidatePath, or revalidateTag, in pages or layouts rendered with force-static.\n\nGood to know:\n\nInstructions on how to migrate from getServerSideProps and getStaticProps to dynamic: 'force-dynamic' and dynamic: 'error' can be found in the upgrade guide.\ndynamicParams\n\nControl what happens when a dynamic segment is visited that was not generated with generateStaticParams.\n\nlayout.tsx | page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport const dynamicParams = true // true | false\ntrue (default): Dynamic segments not included in generateStaticParams are generated on demand.\nfalse: Dynamic segments not included in generateStaticParams will return a 404.\n\nGood to know:\n\nThis option replaces the fallback: true | false | blocking option of getStaticPaths in the pages directory.\nTo statically render all paths the first time they're visited, you'll need to return an empty array in generateStaticParams or utilize export const dynamic = 'force-static'.\nWhen dynamicParams = true, the segment uses Streaming Server Rendering.\nrevalidate\n\nSet the default revalidation time for a layout or page. This option does not override the revalidate value set by individual fetch requests.\n\nlayout.tsx | page.tsx | route.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport const revalidate = false\n// false | 0 | number\nfalse (default): The default heuristic to cache any fetch requests that set their cache option to 'force-cache' or are discovered before a Dynamic API is used. Semantically equivalent to revalidate: Infinity which effectively means the resource should be cached indefinitely. It is still possible for individual fetch requests to use cache: 'no-store' or revalidate: 0 to avoid being cached and make the route dynamically rendered. Or set revalidate to a positive number lower than the route default to increase the revalidation frequency of a route.\n0: Ensure a layout or page is always dynamically rendered even if no Dynamic APIs or uncached data fetches are discovered. This option changes the default of fetch requests that do not set a cache option to 'no-store' but leaves fetch requests that opt into 'force-cache' or use a positive revalidate as is.\nnumber: (in seconds) Set the default revalidation frequency of a layout or page to n seconds.\n\nGood to know:\n\nThe revalidate value needs to be statically analyzable. For example revalidate = 600 is valid, but revalidate = 60 * 10 is not.\nThe revalidate value is not available when using runtime = 'edge'.\nIn Development, Pages are always rendered on-demand and are never cached. This allows you to see changes immediately without waiting for a revalidation period to pass.\nRevalidation Frequency\nThe lowest revalidate across each layout and page of a single route will determine the revalidation frequency of the entire route. This ensures that child pages are revalidated as frequently as their parent layouts.\nIndividual fetch requests can set a lower revalidate than the route's default revalidate to increase the revalidation frequency of the entire route. This allows you to dynamically opt-in to more frequent revalidation for certain routes based on some criteria.\nfetchCache\nThis is an advanced option that should only be used if you specifically need to override the default behavior.\nruntime\n\nWe recommend using the Node.js runtime for rendering your application.

Unlike layouts that persist across routes and maintain state, templates are given a unique key, meaning children Client Components reset their state on navigation.\n\nThey are useful when you need to:\n\nResynchronize useEffect on navigation.\nReset the state of a child Client Components on navigation. For example, an input field.\nTo change default framework behavior. For example, Suspense boundaries inside layouts only show a fallback on first load, while templates show it on every navigation.\nConvention\n\nA template can be defined by exporting a default React component from a template.js file.

They remount when that segment (including its dynamic params) changes. Navigations within deeper segments do not remount higher-level templates. Search params do not trigger remounts.\nState reset: Any Client Component inside the template will reset its state on navigation.\nEffect re-run: Effects like useEffect will re-synchronize as the component remounts.\nDOM reset: DOM elements inside the template are fully recreated.\nTemplates during navigation and remounting\n\nThis section illustrates how templates behave during navigation.

For example, icon1.png, icon2.png, etc. Numbered files will sort lexically.\nFavicons can only be set in the root /app segment. If you need more granularity, you can use icon.\nThe appropriate <link> tags and attributes such as rel, href, type, and sizes are determined by the icon type and metadata of the evaluated file.\nFor example, a 32 by 32px .png file will have type=\"image/png\" and sizes=\"32x32\" attributes.\nsizes=\"any\" is added to icons when the extension is .svg or the image size of the file is not determined.

If the image file size exceeds these limits, the build will fail.\n\nopengraph-image\n\nAdd an opengraph-image.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif) image file to any route segment.\n\n<head> output\n<meta

/>\nGenerate images using code (.js, .ts, .tsx)\n\nIn addition to using literal image files, you can programmatically generate images using code.\n\nGenerate a route segment's shared image by creating an opengraph-image or twitter-image route that default exports a function.\n\nFile convention\tSupported file types\nopengraph-image\t.js, .ts, .tsx\ntwitter-image\t.js, .ts, .tsx\n\nGood to know:\n\nBy default, generated images are statically optimized (generated at build time and cached) unless they use Dynamic APIs or uncached data.\nYou can generate multiple Images in the same file using generateImageMetadata.\nopengraph-image.js and twitter-image.js are special Route Handlers that is cached by default unless it uses a Dynamic API or dynamic config option.\n\nThe easiest way to generate an image is to use the ImageResponse API from next/og.\n\napp/about/opengraph-image.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'\nimport { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'\nimport { join } from 'node:path'\n \n// Image metadata\nexport const alt = 'About Acme'\nexport const size = {\n  width: 1200,\n  height: 630,\n}\n \nexport const contentType =

promise that resolves to an object containing the dynamic route parameters object from the root segment down to the segment opengraph-image or twitter-image is colocated in.\n\nGood to know: If you use generateImageMetadata, the function will also receive an id prop that is a promise resolving to the id value from one of the items returned by generateImageMetadata.\n\napp/shop/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default async function Image({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>\n}) {\n

}>\napp/shop/[tag]/[item]/opengraph-image.js\t/shop/1/2\tPromise<{ tag: '1', item: '2' }>\nReturns\n\nThe default export function should return a Blob | ArrayBuffer | TypedArray | DataView | ReadableStream | Response.\n\nGood to know: ImageResponse satisfies this return type.\n\nConfig exports\n\nYou can optionally configure the image's metadata by exporting alt, size, and contentType variables from opengraph-image or twitter-image route.\n\nOption\tType\nalt\tstring\nsize\t{ width: number; height: number }\ncontentType\tstring - image MIME type\nalt\nopengraph-image.tsx |

content=\"image/png\" />\nRoute Segment Config\n\nopengraph-image and twitter-image are specialized Route Handlers that can use the same route segment configuration options as Pages and Layouts.\n\nExamples\nUsing external data\n\nThis example uses the params object and external data to generate the image.\n\nGood to know: By default, this generated image will be statically optimized. You can configure the individual fetch options or route segments options to change this behavior.\n\napp/posts/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'\n \nexport const alt = 'About Acme'\nexport const size = {\n  width: 1200,\n  height: 630,\n}\nexport const contentType = 'image/png'\n \nexport default async function Image({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>\n}) {\n  const { slug } = await params\n  const post = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${slug}`).then((res) =>\n    res.json()\n  )\n \n  return new ImageResponse(\n    (\n      <div\n        style={{\n          fontSize: 48,\n          background: 'white',\n          width: '100%',\n          height: '100%',\n          display: 'flex',\n          alignItems: 'center',\n          justifyContent: 'center',\n        }}\n      >\n        {post.title}\n      </div>\n    ),\n    {\n      ...size,\n    }\n  )\n}\nUsing Node.js runtime with local assets\n\nThese examples use the Node.js runtime to fetch a local image from the file system and pass it to the <img> src attribute, either as a base64 string or an ArrayBuffer. Place the local asset relative to the project root, not the example source file.\n\napp/opengraph-image.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'\nimport { join } from 'node:path'\nimport { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'\n \nexport default async function Image() {\n  const logoData = await readFile(join(process.cwd(), 'logo.png'), 'base64')\n  const logoSrc = `data:image/png;base64,${logoData}`\n \n  return new ImageResponse(\n    (\n      <div\n        style={{\n          display: 'flex',\n          alignItems: 'center',\n          justifyContent: 'center',\n        }}\n      >\n        <img src={logoSrc} height=\"100\" />\n      </div>\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nPassing an ArrayBuffer to the src attribute of an <img> element is not part of the HTML spec. The rendering engine used by next/og supports it, but because TypeScript definitions follow the spec, you need a @ts-expect-error directive or similar to use this feature\n.\n\napp/opengraph-image.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'\nimport { join } from 'node:path'\nimport { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'\n \nexport default async function Image() {\n  const logoData = await readFile(join(process.cwd(), 'logo.png'))\n  const logoSrc = Uint8Array.from(logoData).buffer\n \n  return new ImageResponse(\n    (\n      <div\n        style={{\n          display: 'flex',\n          alignItems: 'center',\n          justifyContent: 'center',\n        }}\n      >\n        {/* @ts-expect-error Satori accepts ArrayBuffer/typed arrays for <img src> at runtime */}\n        <img src={logoSrc} height=\"100\" />\n      </div>\n    )\n  )\n}\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv16.0.0\tparams is now a promise that resolves to an object\nv13.3.0\topengraph-image and twitter-image introduced.\nPrevious\nmanifest.json\nNext\nrobots.txt\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

    "html": "API Reference\nFunctions\ncacheLife\nCopy page\ncacheLife\n\nThe cacheLife function is used to set the cache lifetime of a function or component. It should be used alongside the use cache directive, and within the scope of the function or component.\n\nUsage\n\nTo use cacheLife, enable the cacheComponents flag in your next.config.js file:\n\nnext.config.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  cacheComponents: true,\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nThen, import and invoke the cacheLife function within the scope of the function or component:\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use cache'\nimport { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  cacheLife('hours')\n  return <div>Page</div>\n}\nReference\nDefault cache profiles\n\nNext.js provides a set of named cache profiles modeled on various timescales. If you don't specify a cache profile in the cacheLife function alongside the use cache directive, Next.js will automatically apply the default cache profile.\n\nHowever, we recommend always adding a cache profile when using the use cache directive to explicitly define caching behavior.\n\nProfile\tstale\trevalidate\texpire\tDescription\ndefault\t5 minutes\t15 minutes\t1 year\tDefault profile, suitable for content that doesn't need frequent updates\nseconds\t30 seconds\t1 second\t1 minute\tFor rapidly changing content requiring near real-time updates\nminutes\t5 minutes\t1 minute\t1 hour\tFor content that updates frequently within an hour\nhours\t5 minutes\t1 hour\t1 day\tFor content that updates daily but can be slightly stale\ndays\t5 minutes\t1 day\t1 week\tFor content that updates weekly but can be a day old\nweeks\t5 minutes\t1 week\t30 days\tFor content that updates monthly but can be a week old\nmax\t5 minutes\t30 days\t1 year\tFor very stable content that rarely needs updating\n\nThe string values used to reference cache profiles don't carry inherent meaning; instead they serve as semantic labels. This allows you to better understand and manage your cached content within your codebase.\n\nGood to know: Updating the staleTimes and expireTime config options also updates the stale and expire properties of the default cache profile.\n\nCustom cache profiles\n\nYou can configure custom cache profiles by adding them to the cacheLife option in your next.config.ts file.\n\nCache profiles are objects that contain the following properties:\n\nProperty\tValue\tDescription\tRequirement\nstale\tnumber\tDuration the client should cache a value without checking the server.\tOptional\nrevalidate\tnumber\tFrequency at which the cache should refresh on the server; stale values may be served while revalidating.\tOptional\nexpire\tnumber\tMaximum duration for which a value can remain stale before switching to dynamic fetching; must be longer than revalidate.\tOptional - Must be longer than revalidate\n\nThe \"stale\" property differs from the staleTimes setting in that it specifically controls client-side router caching. While staleTimes is a global setting that affects all instances of both dynamic and static data, the cacheLife configuration allows you to define \"stale\" times on a per-function or per-route basis.\n\nstale time in the client router cache\n\nThe \"stale\" property does not set the Cache-control: max-age header. Instead, it controls the client-side router cache. The server sends this value to the client via the x-nextjs-stale-time response header (in seconds), which the client router uses to determine how long to cache the route before needing to revalidate.\n\nThe client enforces a minimum stale time of 30 seconds: This ensures that prefetched data remains usable long enough for users to click on links after they've been prefetched. Without this minimum, very short stale times would cause prefetched data to expire before it could be used, making prefetching ineffective.\n\nThis minimum only applies to time-based expiration. When you call revalidateTag, revalidatePath, updateTag, or refresh from a Server Action, the entire client cache is immediately cleared, bypassing the stale time entirely.\n\nExamples\nDefining reusable cache profiles\n\nYou can create a reusable cache profile by defining them in your next.config.ts file. Choose a name that suits your use case and set values for the stale, revalidate, and expire properties. You can create as many custom cache profiles as needed. Each profile can be referenced by its name as a string value passed to the cacheLife function.\n\nnext.config.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  cacheComponents: true,\n  cacheLife: {\n    biweekly: {\n      stale: 60 * 60 * 24 * 14, // 14 days\n      revalidate: 60 * 60 * 24, // 1 day\n      expire: 60 * 60 * 24 * 14, // 14 days\n    },\n  },\n}\n \nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n\nThe example above caches for 14 days, checks for updates daily, and expires the cache after 14 days. You can then reference this profile throughout your application by its name:\n\napp/page.tsx\n'use cache'\nimport { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  cacheLife('biweekly')\n  return <div>Page</div>\n}\nOverriding the default cache profiles\n\nWhile the default cache profiles provide a useful way to think about how fresh or stale any given part of cacheable output can be, you may prefer different named profiles to better align with your applications caching strategies.\n\nYou can override the default named cache profiles by creating a new configuration with the same name as the defaults.\n\nThe example below shows how to override the default “days” cache profile:\n\nnext.config.ts\nconst nextConfig = {\n  cacheComponents: true,\n  cacheLife: {\n    days: {\n      stale: 3600, // 1 hour\n      revalidate: 900, // 15 minutes\n      expire: 86400, // 1 day\n    },\n  },\n}\n \nmodule.exports = nextConfig\nDefining cache profiles inline\n\nFor specific use cases, you can set a custom cache profile by passing an object to the cacheLife function:\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use cache'\nimport { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  cacheLife({\n    stale: 3600, // 1 hour\n    revalidate: 900, // 15 minutes\n    expire: 86400, // 1 day\n  })\n \n  return <div>Page</div>\n}\n\nThis inline cache profile will only be applied to the function or file it was created in. If you want to reuse the same profile throughout your application, you can add the configuration to the cacheLife property of your next.config.ts file.\n\nNested usage of use cache and cacheLife\n\nWhen defining multiple caching behaviors in the same route or component tree, if the inner caches specify their own cacheLife profile, the outer cache will respect the shortest cache duration among them. This applies only if the outer cache does not have its own explicit cacheLife profile defined.\n\nFor example, if you add the use cache directive to your page, without specifying a cache profile, the default cache profile will be applied implicitly (cacheLife(”default”)). If a component imported into the page also uses the use cache directive with its own cache profile, the outer and inner cache profiles are compared, and shortest duration set in the profiles will be applied.\n\napp/components/parent.tsx\n// Parent component\nimport { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'\nimport { ChildComponent } from './child'\n \nexport async function ParentComponent() {\n  'use cache'\n  cacheLife('days')\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ChildComponent />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nAnd in a separate file, we defined the Child component that was imported:\n\napp/components/child.tsx\n// Child component\nimport { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport async function ChildComponent() {\n  'use cache'\n  cacheLife('hours')\n  return <div>Child Content</div>\n \n  // This component's cache will respect the shorter 'hours' profile\n}\nRelated\nView related API references.\ncacheComponents\nLearn how to enable the cacheComponents flag in Next.js.\nuse cache\nLearn how to use the use cache directive to cache data in your Next.js application.\nrevalidateTag\nAPI Reference for the revalidateTag function.\ncacheTag\nLearn how to use the cacheTag function to manage cache invalidation in your Next.js application.\nPrevious\nafter\nNext\ncacheTag\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

You must use async/await or React's use\n function to access cookies.\nIn version 14 and earlier, cookies was a synchronous function. To help with backwards compatibility, you can still access it synchronously in Next.js 15, but this behavior will be deprecated in the future.\ncookies is a Dynamic API whose returned values cannot be known ahead of time. Using it in a layout or page will opt a route into dynamic rendering.\nThe .delete method can only be called:\nIn a Server Action or Route Handler.\nIf it belongs to the same domain from which .set is called. For wildcard domains, the specific subdomain must be an exact match. Additionally, the code must be executed on the same protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) as the cookie you want to delete.\nHTTP does not allow setting cookies after streaming starts, so you must use .set in a Server Action or Route Handler.\nUnderstanding Cookie Behavior in Server Components\n\nWhen working with cookies in Server Components, it's important to understand that cookies are fundamentally a client-side storage mechanism:\n\nReading cookies works in Server Components because you're accessing the cookie data that the client's browser sends to the server in the HTTP request headers.\nSetting cookies cannot be done directly in a Server Component, even when using a Route Handler or Server Action. This is because cookies are actually stored by the browser, not the server.\n\nThe server can only send instructions (via Set-Cookie headers) to tell the browser to store cookies - the actual storage happens on the client side. This is why cookie operations that modify state (.set, .delete, .clear) must be performed in a Route Handler or Server Action where the response headers can be properly set.\n\nUnderstanding Cookie Behavior in Server Actions\n\nAfter you set or delete a cookie in a Server Action, Next.js re-renders the current page and its layouts on the server so the UI reflects the new cookie value. See the Caching guide.\n\nThe UI is not unmounted, but effects that depend on data coming from the server will re-run.\n\nTo refresh cached data too, call revalidatePath or revalidateTag inside the action.\n\nExamples\nGetting a cookie\n\nYou can use the (await cookies()).get('name') method to get a single cookie:\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  const cookieStore = await cookies()\n  const theme = cookieStore.get('theme')\n  return '...'\n}\nGetting all cookies\n\nYou can use the (await cookies()).getAll() method to get all cookies with a matching name. If name is unspecified, it returns all the available cookies.\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  const cookieStore = await cookies()\n  return cookieStore.getAll().map((cookie) => (\n    <div key={cookie.name}>\n      <p>Name: {cookie.name}</p>\n      <p>Value: {cookie.value}</p>\n    </div>\n  ))\n}\nSetting a cookie\n\nYou can use the (await cookies()).set(name, value, options) method in a Server Action or Route Handler to set a cookie. The options object is optional.\n\napp/actions.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use server'\n \nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport async function create(data) {\n  const cookieStore = await cookies()\n \n  cookieStore.set('name', 'lee')\n  // or\n  cookieStore.set('name', 'lee', { secure: true })\n  // or\n  cookieStore.set({\n    name: 'name',\n    value: 'lee',\n    httpOnly: true,\n    path: '/',\n  })\n}\nChecking if a cookie exists\n\nYou can use the (await cookies()).has(name) method to check if a cookie exists:\n\napp/page.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  const cookieStore = await cookies()\n  const hasCookie = cookieStore.has('theme')\n  return '...'\n}\nDeleting cookies\n\nThere are three ways you can delete a cookie.\n\nUsing the delete() method:\n\napp/actions.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use server'\n \nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport async function delete(data) {\n  (await cookies()).delete('name')\n}\n\nSetting a new cookie with the same name and an empty value:\n\napp/actions.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use server'\n \nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport async function delete(data) {\n  (await cookies()).set('name', '')\n}\n\nSetting the maxAge to 0 will immediately expire a cookie. maxAge accepts a value in seconds.\n\napp/actions.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use server'\n \nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers'\n \nexport async function delete(data) {\n  (await cookies()).set('name', 'value', { maxAge: 0 })\n}\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv15.0.0-RC\tcookies is now an async function.

If Dynamic APIs are detected on the route, Next.js will fetch the resource on every request.\nno-store: Next.js fetches the resource from the remote server on every request, even if Dynamic APIs are not detected on the route.\nforce-cache: Next.js looks for a matching request in its Data Cache.\nIf there is a match and it is fresh, it will be returned from the cache.\nIf there is no match or a stale match, Next.js will fetch the resource from the remote server and update the cache with the downloaded resource.\noptions.next.revalidate\nfetch(`https://...`, { next: { revalidate: false | 0 | number } })\n\nSet the cache lifetime of a resource (in seconds). Data Cache.\n\nfalse - Cache the resource indefinitely. Semantically equivalent to revalidate: Infinity. The HTTP cache may evict older resources over time.\n0 - Prevent the resource from being cached.\nnumber - (in seconds) Specify the resource should have a cache lifetime of at most n seconds.\n\nGood to know:\n\nIf an individual fetch() request sets a revalidate number lower than the default revalidate of a route, the whole route revalidation interval will be decreased.\nIf two fetch requests with the same URL in the same route have different revalidate values, the lower value will be used.\nConflicting options such as { revalidate: 3600, cache: 'no-store' } are not allowed, both will be ignored, and in development mode a warning will be printed to the terminal.\noptions.next.tags\nfetch(`https://...`, { next: { tags: ['collection'] } })\n\nSet the cache tags of a resource. Data can then be revalidated on-demand using revalidateTag. The max length for a custom tag is 256 characters and the max tag items is 128.\n\nTroubleshooting\nFetch default auto no store and cache: 'no-store' not showing fresh data in development\n\nNext.js caches fetch responses in Server Components across Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in local development for faster responses and to reduce costs for billed API calls.\n\nBy default, the HMR cache applies to all fetch requests, including those with the default auto no cache and cache: 'no-store' option. This means uncached requests will not show fresh data between HMR refreshes. However, the cache will be cleared on navigation or full-page reloads.\n\nSee the serverComponentsHmrCache docs for more information.\n\nHard refresh and caching in development\n\nIn development mode, if the request includes the cache-control: no-cache header, options.cache, options.next.revalidate, and options.next.tags are ignored, and the fetch request is served from the source.\n\nBrowsers typically include cache-control: no-cache when the cache is disabled in developer tools or during a hard refresh.\n\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv13.0.0\tfetch introduced.\nPrevious\ndraftMode\nNext\nforbidden\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

This means:\ntitle.default is required when you add a title.template.\ntitle.template defined in layout.js will not apply to a title defined in a page.js of the same route segment.\ntitle.template defined in page.js has no effect because a page is always the terminating segment (it doesn't have any children route segments).\ntitle.template has no effect if a route has not defined a title or title.default.\nabsolute\n\ntitle.absolute can be used to provide a title that ignores title.template set in parent segments.\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: {\n    template: '%s | Acme',\n  },\n}\napp/about/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: {\n    absolute: 'About',\n  },\n}\n \n// Output: <title>About</title>\n\nGood to know:\n\nlayout.js\ntitle (string) and title.default define the default title for child segments (that do not define their own title). It will augment title.template from the closest parent segment if it exists.\ntitle.absolute defines the default title for child segments.

content=\"telephone=no, address=no, email=no\" />\nmetadataBase\n\nmetadataBase is a convenience option to set a base URL prefix for metadata fields that require a fully qualified URL.\n\nmetadataBase allows URL-based metadata fields defined in the current route segment and below to use a relative path instead of an otherwise required absolute URL.\nThe field's relative path will be composed with metadataBase to form a fully qualified URL.\nlayout.js | page.js\nexport const metadata = {\n  metadataBase: new URL('https://acme.com'),\n  alternates: {\n    canonical: '/',\n    languages: {\n      'en-US': '/en-US',\n      'de-DE': '/de-DE',\n    },\n  },\n  openGraph: {\n    images: '/og-image.png',\n  },\n}\n<head> output\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://acme.com\" />\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en-US\" href=\"https://acme.com/en-US\" />\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"de-DE\" href=\"https://acme.com/de-DE\" />\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://acme.com/og-image.png\" />\n\nGood to know:\n\nmetadataBase is typically set in root app/layout.js to apply to URL-based metadata fields across all routes.\nAll URL-based metadata fields that require absolute URLs can be configured with a metadataBase option.\nmetadataBase can contain a subdomain e.g. https://app.acme.com or base path e.g. https://acme.com/start/from/here\nIf a metadata field provides an absolute URL, metadataBase will be ignored.\nUsing a relative path in a URL-based metadata field without configuring a metadataBase will cause a build error.\nNext.js will normalize duplicate slashes between metadataBase (e.g. https://acme.com/) and a relative field (e.g. /path) to a single slash (e.g. https://acme.com/path)\nURL Composition\n\nURL composition favors developer intent over default directory traversal semantics.\n\nTrailing slashes between metadataBase and metadata fields are normalized.\nAn \"absolute\" path in a metadata field (that typically would replace the whole URL path) is treated as a \"relative\" path (starting from the end of metadataBase).\n\nFor example, given the following metadataBase:\n\napp/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  metadataBase: new URL('https://acme.com'),\n}\n\nAny metadata fields that inherit the above metadataBase and set their own value will be resolved as follows:\n\nmetadata field\tResolved URL\n/\thttps://acme.com\n./\thttps://acme.com\npayments\thttps://acme.com/payments\n/payments\thttps://acme.com/payments\n./payments\thttps://acme.com/payments\n../payments\thttps://acme.com/payments\nhttps://beta.acme.com/payments\thttps://beta.acme.com/payments\nopenGraph\nlayout.js

The browser uses this information to apply preloading optimizations depending on the keyword.\n\nWhile the Metadata API doesn't directly support these hints, you can use new ReactDOM methods\n to safely insert them into the <head> of the document.\n\napp/preload-resources.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\n \nexport function PreloadResources() {\n  ReactDOM.preload('...', { as: '...' })\n  ReactDOM.preconnect('...', { crossOrigin: '...' })\n  ReactDOM.prefetchDNS('...')\n \n  return '...'\n}\n<link rel=\"preload\">\n\nStart loading a resource early in the page rendering (browser) lifecycle.

MDN Docs\n.\n\nReactDOM.prefetchDNS(href: string)\n<head> output\n<link rel=\"dns-prefetch\" href=\"...\" />\n\nGood to know:\n\nThese methods are currently only supported in Client Components, which are still Server Side Rendered on initial page load.\nNext.js in-built features such as next/font, next/image and next/script automatically handle relevant resource hints.\nBehavior\nDefault Fields\n\nThere are two default meta tags that are always added even if a route doesn't define metadata:\n\nThe meta charset tag\n sets the character encoding for the website.\nThe meta viewport tag\n sets the viewport width and scale for the website to adjust for different devices.\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\nGood to know: You can overwrite the default viewport meta tag.\n\nStreaming metadata\n\nStreaming metadata allows Next.js to render and send the initial UI to the browser, without waiting for generateMetadata to complete.\n\nWhen generateMetadata resolves, the resulting metadata tags are appended to the <body> tag. We have verified that metadata is interpreted correctly by bots that execute JavaScript and inspect the full DOM (e.g. Googlebot).\n\nFor HTML-limited bots that can’t execute JavaScript (e.g. facebookexternalhit), metadata continues to block page rendering. The resulting metadata will be available in the <head> tag.\n\nNext.js automatically detects HTML-limited bots by looking at the User Agent header. You can use the htmlLimitedBots option in your Next.js config file to override the default User Agent list\n.\n\nTo fully disable streaming metadata:\n\nnext.config.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst config: NextConfig = {\n  htmlLimitedBots: /.*/,\n}\n \nexport default config\n\nStreaming metadata improves perceived performance by reducing TTFB\n and can help lowering LCP\n time.\n\nOverriding htmlLimitedBots could lead to longer response times. Streaming metadata is an advanced feature, and the default should be sufficient for most cases.\n\nOrdering\n\nMetadata is evaluated in order, starting from the root segment down to the segment closest to the final page.js segment. For example:\n\napp/layout.tsx (Root Layout)\napp/blog/layout.tsx (Nested Blog Layout)\napp/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (Blog Page)\nMerging\n\nFollowing the evaluation order, Metadata objects exported from multiple segments in the same route are shallowly merged together to form the final metadata output of a route. Duplicate keys are replaced based on their ordering.\n\nThis means metadata with nested fields such as openGraph and robots that are defined in an earlier segment are overwritten by the last segment to define them.\n\nOverwriting fields\napp/layout.js\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Acme',\n  openGraph: {\n    title: 'Acme',\n    description: 'Acme is a...',\n  },\n}\napp/blog/page.js\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Blog',\n  openGraph: {\n    title: 'Blog',\n  },\n}\n \n// Output:\n// <title>Blog</title>\n// <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Blog\" />\n\nIn the example above:\n\ntitle from app/layout.js is replaced by title in app/blog/page.js.\nAll openGraph fields from app/layout.js are replaced in app/blog/page.js because app/blog/page.js sets openGraph metadata. Note the absence of openGraph.description.\n\nIf you'd like to share some nested fields between segments while overwriting others, you can pull them out into a separate variable:\n\napp/shared-metadata.js\nexport const openGraphImage = { images: ['http://...'] }\napp/page.js\nimport { openGraphImage } from './shared-metadata'\n \nexport const metadata = {\n  openGraph: {\n    ...openGraphImage,\n    title: 'Home',\n  },\n}\napp/about/page.js\nimport { openGraphImage } from '../shared-metadata'\n \nexport const metadata = {\n  openGraph: {\n    ...openGraphImage,\n    title: 'About',\n  },\n}\n\nIn the example above, the OG image is shared between app/layout.js and app/about/page.js while the titles are different.\n\nInheriting fields\napp/layout.js\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Acme',\n  openGraph: {\n    title: 'Acme',\n    description: 'Acme is a...',\n  },\n}\napp/about/page.js\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'About',\n}\n \n// Output:\n// <title>About</title>\n// <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Acme\" />\n// <meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Acme is a...\" />\n\nNotes\n\ntitle from app/layout.js is replaced by title in app/about/page.js.\nAll openGraph fields from app/layout.js are inherited in app/about/page.js because app/about/page.js doesn't set openGraph metadata.\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv15.2.0\tIntroduced streaming support to generateMetadata.\nv13.2.0\tviewport, themeColor, and colorScheme deprecated in favor of the viewport configuration.\nv13.2.0\tmetadata and generateMetadata introduced.\nNext Steps\nView all the Metadata API options.\nMetadata Files\nAPI documentation for the metadata file conventions.\ngenerateViewport\nAPI Reference for the generateViewport function.\nPrevious\ngenerateImageMetadata\nNext\ngenerateSitemaps\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

For example, you can use the request.nextUrl property to get the current URL, and then modify it to redirect to a different URL.\n\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \n// Given an incoming request...\nconst loginUrl = new URL('/login', request.url)\n// Add ?from=/incoming-url to the /login URL\nloginUrl.searchParams.set('from', request.nextUrl.pathname)\n// And redirect to the new URL\nreturn NextResponse.redirect(loginUrl)\nrewrite()\n\nProduce a response that rewrites (proxies) the given URL\n while preserving the original URL.\n\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \n// Incoming request: /about, browser shows /about\n// Rewritten request: /proxy, browser shows /about\nreturn NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/proxy', request.url))\nnext()\n\nThe next() method is useful for Proxy, as it allows you to return early and continue routing.\n\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nreturn NextResponse.next()\n\nYou can also forward headers upstream when producing the response, using NextResponse.next({ request: { headers } }):\n\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \n// Given an incoming request...\nconst newHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)\n// Add a new header\nnewHeaders.set('x-version', '123')\n// Forward the modified request headers upstream\nreturn NextResponse.next({\n  request: {\n    // New request headers\n    headers: newHeaders,\n  },\n})\n\nThis forwards newHeaders upstream to the target page, route, or server action, and does not expose them to the client. While this pattern is useful for passing data upstream, it should be used with caution because the headers containing this data may be forwarded to external services.\n\nIn contrast, NextResponse.next({ headers }) is a shorthand for sending headers from proxy to the client. This is NOT good practice and should be avoided. Among other reasons because setting response headers like Content-Type, can override framework expectations (for example, the Content-Type used by Server Actions), leading to failed submissions or broken streaming responses.\n\nimport { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nasync function proxy(request: NextRequest) {\n  const headers = await injectAuth(request.headers)\n  // DO NOT forward headers like this\n  return NextResponse.next({ headers })\n}\n\nIn general, avoid copying all incoming request headers because doing so can leak sensitive data to clients or upstream services.\n\nPrefer a defensive approach by creating a subset of incoming request headers using an allow-list. For example, you might discard custom x-* headers and only forward known-safe headers:\n\nimport { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nfunction proxy(request: NextRequest) {\n  const incoming = new Headers(request.headers)\n  const forwarded = new Headers()\n \n  for (const [name, value] of incoming) {\n    const headerName = name.toLowerCase()\n    // Keep only known-safe headers, discard custom x-* and other sensitive ones\n    if (\n      !headerName.startsWith('x-') &&\n      headerName !== 'authorization' &&\n      headerName !== 'cookie'\n    ) {\n      // Preserve original header name casing\n      forwarded.set(name, value)\n    }\n  }\n \n  return NextResponse.next({\n    request: {\n      headers: forwarded,\n    },\n  })\n}\nPrevious\nNextRequest\nNext\nnotFound\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

While traditionally a 302 was used for a temporary redirect, and a 301 for a permanent redirect, many browsers changed the request method of the redirect, from a POST to GET request when using a 302, regardless of the origins request method.\n\nTaking the following example of a redirect from /users to /people, if you make a POST request to /users to create a new user, and are conforming to a 302 temporary redirect, the request method will be changed from a POST to a GET request. This doesn't make sense, as to create a new user, you should be making a POST request to /people, and not a GET request.\n\nThe introduction of the 307 status code means that the request method is preserved as POST.\n\n302 - Temporary redirect, will change the request method from POST to GET\n307 - Temporary redirect, will preserve the request method as POST\n\nThe redirect() method uses a 307 by default, instead of a 302 temporary redirect, meaning your requests will always be preserved as POST requests.\n\nLearn more\n about HTTP Redirects.\n\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv13.0.0\tredirect introduced.\nNext Steps\npermanentRedirect\nAPI Reference for the permanentRedirect function.\nPrevious\npermanentRedirect\nNext\nrefresh\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

Currently, it also causes all previously visited pages to refresh when navigated to again. This behavior is temporary and will be updated in the future to apply only to the specific path.\nRoute Handlers: Marks the path for revalidation. The revalidation is done on the next visit to the specified path. This means calling revalidatePath with a dynamic route segment will not immediately trigger many revalidations at once. The invalidation only happens when the path is next visited.\nParameters\nrevalidatePath(path: string, type?: 'page' | 'layout'): void;\npath: Either a route pattern corresponding to the data you want to revalidate, for example /product/[slug], or a specific URL, /product/123. Do not append /page or /layout, use the type parameter instead. Must not exceed 1024 characters. This value is case-sensitive.\ntype: (optional) 'page' or 'layout' string to change the type of path to revalidate. If path contains a dynamic segment, for example /product/[slug], this parameter is required. If path is a specific URL, /product/1, omit type.\n\nUse a specific URL when you want to refresh a single page. Use a route pattern plus type to refresh multiple URLs.\n\nReturns\n\nrevalidatePath does not return a value.\n\nWhat can be invalidated\n\nThe path parameter can point to pages, layouts, or route handlers:\n\nPages: Invalidates the specific page\nLayouts: Invalidates the layout (the layout.tsx at that segment), all nested layouts beneath it, and all pages beneath them\nRoute Handlers: Invalidates Data Cache entries accessed within route handlers. For example revalidatePath(\"/api/data\") invalidates this GET handler:\napp/api/data/route.ts\nexport async function GET() {\n  const data = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog', {\n    cache: 'force-cache',\n  })\n \n  return Response.json(await data.json())\n}\nRelationship with revalidateTag and updateTag\n\nrevalidatePath, revalidateTag and updateTag serve different purposes:\n\nrevalidatePath: Invalidates a specific page or layout path\nrevalidateTag: Marks data with specific tags as stale.

This will not invalidate pages beneath the specific page. For example, /blog/[slug] won't invalidate /blog/[slug]/[author].\n\nRevalidating a Layout path\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\nrevalidatePath('/blog/[slug]', 'layout')\n// or with route groups\nrevalidatePath('/(main)/post/[slug]', 'layout')\n\nThis will invalidate any URL that matches the provided layout file for revalidation on the next page visit. This will cause pages beneath with the same layout to be invalidated and revalidated on the next visit. For example, in the above case, /blog/[slug]/[another] would also be invalidated and revalidated on the next visit.\n\nRevalidating all data\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n \nrevalidatePath('/', 'layout')\n\nThis will purge the Client-side Router Cache, and invalidate the Data Cache for revalidation on the next page visit.\n\nServer Function\napp/actions.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use server'\n \nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport default async function submit() {\n  await submitForm()\n  revalidatePath('/')\n}\nRoute Handler\napp/api/revalidate/route.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport async function GET(request: NextRequest) {\n  const path = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('path')\n \n  if (path) {\n    revalidatePath(path)\n    return Response.json({ revalidated: true, now: Date.now() })\n  }\n \n  return Response.json({\n    revalidated: false,\n    now: Date.now(),\n    message: 'Missing path to revalidate',\n  })\n}\nPrevious\nrefresh\nNext\nrevalidateTag\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

    "html": "API Reference\nFunctions\nrevalidateTag\nCopy page\nrevalidateTag\n\nrevalidateTag allows you to invalidate cached data on-demand for a specific cache tag.\n\nThis function is ideal for content where a slight delay in updates is acceptable, such as blog posts, product catalogs, or documentation. Users receive stale content while fresh data loads in the background.\n\nUsage\n\nrevalidateTag can be called in Server Functions and Route Handlers.\n\nrevalidateTag cannot be called in Client Components or Proxy, as it only works in server environments.\n\nRevalidation Behavior\n\nThe revalidation behavior depends on whether you provide the second argument:\n\nWith profile=\"max\" (recommended): The tag entry is marked as stale, and the next time a resource with that tag is visited, it will use stale-while-revalidate semantics. This means the stale content is served while fresh content is fetched in the background.\nWith a custom cache life profile: For advanced usage, you can specify any cache life profile that your application has defined, allowing for custom revalidation behaviors tailored to your specific caching requirements.\nWithout the second argument (deprecated): The tag entry is expired immediately, and the next request to that resource will be a blocking revalidate/cache miss. This behavior is now deprecated, and you should either use profile=\"max\" or migrate to updateTag.\n\nGood to know: When using profile=\"max\", revalidateTag marks tagged data as stale, but fresh data is only fetched when pages using that tag are next visited. This means calling revalidateTag will not immediately trigger many revalidations at once. The invalidation only happens when any page using that tag is next visited.\n\nParameters\nrevalidateTag(tag: string, profile?: string | { expire?: number }): void;\ntag: A string representing the cache tag associated with the data you want to revalidate. Must not exceed 256 characters. This value is case-sensitive.\nprofile: A string that specifies the revalidation behavior. The recommended value is \"max\" which provides stale-while-revalidate semantics, or any of the other default or custom profiles defined in cacheLife. Alternatively, you can pass an object with an expire property for custom expiration behavior.\n\nTags must first be assigned to cached data. You can do this in two ways:\n\nUsing the next.tags option with fetch for caching external API requests:\nfetch(url, { next: { tags: ['posts'] } })\nUsing cacheTag inside cached functions or components with the 'use cache' directive:\nimport { cacheTag } from 'next/cache'\n \nasync function getData() {\n  'use cache'\n  cacheTag('posts')\n  // ...\n}\nReturns\n\nrevalidateTag does not return a value.\n\nRelationship with revalidatePath\n\nrevalidateTag invalidates data with specific tags across all pages that use those tags, while revalidatePath invalidates specific page or layout paths.\n\nGood to know: These functions serve different purposes and may need to be used together for comprehensive data consistency. For detailed examples and considerations, see relationship with revalidateTag and updateTag for more information.\n\nExamples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to use revalidateTag in different contexts. In both cases, we're using profile=\"max\" to mark data as stale and use stale-while-revalidate semantics, which is the recommended approach for most use cases.\n\nServer Action\napp/actions.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use server'\n \nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport default async function submit() {\n  await addPost()\n  revalidateTag('posts', 'max')\n}\nRoute Handler\napp/api/revalidate/route.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport async function GET(request: NextRequest) {\n  const tag = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get('tag')\n \n  if (tag) {\n    revalidateTag(tag, 'max')\n    return Response.json({ revalidated: true, now: Date.now() })\n  }\n \n  return Response.json({\n    revalidated: false,\n    now: Date.now(),\n    message: 'Missing tag to revalidate',\n  })\n}\n\nGood to know: For webhooks or third-party services that need immediate expiration, you can pass { expire: 0 } as the second argument: revalidateTag(tag, { expire: 0 }). This pattern is necessary when external systems call your Route Handlers and require data to expire immediately. For all other cases, it's recommended to use updateTag in Server Actions for immediate updates instead.\n\nPrevious\nrevalidatePath\nNext\nunauthorized\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

Try it out and share your feedback on GitHub.\n\nunstable_rethrow can be used to avoid catching internal errors thrown by Next.js when attempting to handle errors thrown in your application code.\n\nFor example, calling the notFound function will throw an internal Next.js error and render the not-found.js component.

If you use generateStaticParams the Suspense boundary is optional\n\napp/example-client-component.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function ExampleClientComponent() {\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n  return <p>Current pathname: {pathname}</p>\n}\n\nusePathname intentionally requires using a Client Component. It's important to note Client Components are not a de-optimization. They are an integral part of the Server Components architecture.\n\nFor example, a Client Component with usePathname will be rendered into HTML on the initial page load. When navigating to a new route, this component does not need to be re-fetched. Instead, the component is downloaded once (in the client JavaScript bundle), and re-renders based on the current state.\n\nGood to know:\n\nReading the current URL from a Server Component is not supported. This design is intentional to support layout state being preserved across page navigations.\nIf your page is being statically pre-rendered and your app has rewrites in next.config or a Proxy file, reading the pathname with usePathname() can result in hydration mismatch errors—because the initial value comes from the server and may not match the actual browser pathname after routing. See our example for a way to mitigate this issue.\nCompatibility with Pages Router\nParameters\nconst pathname = usePathname()\n\nusePathname does not take any parameters.\n\nReturns\n\nusePathname returns a string of the current URL's pathname.

If the page is then reached through a rewrite using next.config or Proxy, the browser URL may differ, and usePathname() will read the rewritten pathname on the client.\n\nTo avoid hydration mismatches, design the UI so that only a small, isolated part depends on the client pathname.

This confines the client boundary exclusively to the WebVitals component.\n\nuseReportWebVitals\n\nThe metric object passed as the hook's argument consists of a number of properties:\n\nid: Unique identifier for the metric in the context of the current page load\nname: The name of the performance metric. Possible values include names of Web Vitals metrics (TTFB, FCP, LCP, FID, CLS) specific to a web application.\ndelta: The difference between the current value and the previous value of the metric. The value is typically in milliseconds and represents the change in the metric's value over time.\nentries: An array of Performance Entries\n associated with the metric. These entries provide detailed information about the performance events related to the metric.\nnavigationType: Indicates the type of navigation\n that triggered the metric collection. Possible values include \"navigate\", \"reload\", \"back_forward\", and \"prerender\".\nrating: A qualitative rating of the metric value, providing an assessment of the performance. Possible values are \"good\", \"needs-improvement\", and \"poor\". The rating is typically determined by comparing the metric value against predefined thresholds that indicate acceptable or suboptimal performance.\nvalue: The actual value or duration of the performance entry, typically in milliseconds. The value provides a quantitative measure of the performance aspect being tracked by the metric. The source of the value depends on the specific metric being measured and can come from various Performance API\ns.\nWeb Vitals\n\nWeb Vitals\n are a set of useful metrics that aim to capture the user experience of a web page.

You can then pass it down by props to any component (Server or Client) within that Page.\nIf an application includes the /pages directory, useSearchParams will return ReadonlyURLSearchParams | null. The null value is for compatibility during migration since search params cannot be known during pre-rendering of a page that doesn't use getServerSideProps\nBehavior\nStatic Rendering\n\nIf a route is statically rendered, calling useSearchParams will cause the Client Component tree up to the closest Suspense boundary to be client-side rendered.\n\nThis allows a part of the route to be statically rendered while the dynamic part that uses useSearchParams is client-side rendered.\n\nWe recommend wrapping the Client Component that uses useSearchParams in a <Suspense/> boundary. This will allow any Client Components above it to be statically rendered and sent as part of initial HTML. Example.\n\nFor example:\n\napp/dashboard/search-bar.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function SearchBar() {\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n \n  const search = searchParams.get('search')\n \n  // This will not be logged on the server when using static rendering\n  console.log(search)\n \n  return <>Search: {search}</>\n}\napp/dashboard/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { Suspense } from 'react'\nimport SearchBar from './search-bar'\n \n// This component passed as a fallback to the Suspense boundary\n// will be rendered in place of the search bar in the initial HTML.\n// When the value is available during React hydration the fallback\n// will be replaced with the `<SearchBar>` component.\nfunction SearchBarFallback() {\n  return <>placeholder</>\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <Suspense fallback={<SearchBarFallback />}>\n          <SearchBar />\n        </Suspense>\n      </nav>\n      <h1>Dashboard</h1>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nIn development, routes are rendered on-demand, so useSearchParams doesn't suspend and things may appear to work without Suspense.\nDuring production builds, a static page that calls useSearchParams from a Client Component must be wrapped in a Suspense boundary, otherwise the build fails with the Missing Suspense boundary with useSearchParams error.\nIf you intend the route to be dynamically rendered, prefer using the connection function first in a Server Component to wait for an incoming request, this excludes everything below from prerendering. See what makes a route dynamic in the Dynamic Rendering guide.\nIf you're already in a Server Component Page, consider using the searchParams prop and passing the values to Client Components.\nYou can also pass the Page searchParams prop directly to a Client Component and unwrap it with React's use(). Although this will suspend, so the Client Component should be wrapped with a Suspense boundary.\nDynamic Rendering\n\nIf a route is dynamically rendered, useSearchParams will be available on the server during the initial server render of the Client Component.\n\nFor example:\n\napp/dashboard/search-bar.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nimport { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function SearchBar() {\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n \n  const search = searchParams.get('search')\n \n  // This will be logged on the server during the initial render\n  // and on the client on subsequent navigations.\n  console.log(search)\n \n  return <>Search: {search}</>\n}\napp/dashboard/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { connection } from 'next/server'\nimport SearchBar from './search-bar'\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  await connection()\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <SearchBar />\n      </nav>\n      <h1>Dashboard</h1>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nPreviously, setting export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic' on the page was used to force dynamic rendering. Prefer using connection() instead, as it semantically ties dynamic rendering to the incoming request.\nServer Components\nPages\n\nTo access search params in Pages (Server Components), use the searchParams prop.\n\nLayouts\n\nUnlike Pages, Layouts (Server Components) do not receive the searchParams prop. This is because a shared layout is not re-rendered during navigation which could lead to stale searchParams between navigations. View detailed explanation.\n\nInstead, use the Page searchParams prop or the useSearchParams hook in a Client Component, which is re-rendered on the client with the latest searchParams.\n\nExamples\nUpdating searchParams\n\nYou can use useRouter or Link to set new searchParams. After a navigation is performed, the current page.js will receive an updated searchParams prop.\n\napp/example-client-component.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\n'use client'\n \nexport default function ExampleClientComponent() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n \n  // Get a new searchParams string by merging the current\n  // searchParams with a provided key/value pair\n  const createQueryString = useCallback(\n    (name: string, value: string) => {\n      const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())\n      params.set(name, value)\n \n      return params.toString()\n    },\n    [searchParams]\n  )\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <p>Sort By</p>\n \n      {/* using useRouter */}\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          // <pathname>?sort=asc\n          router.push(pathname + '?' + createQueryString('sort', 'asc'))\n        }}\n      >\n        ASC\n      </button>\n \n      {/* using <Link> */}\n      <Link\n        href={\n          // <pathname>?sort=desc\n          pathname + '?' + createQueryString('sort', 'desc')\n        }\n      >\n        DESC\n      </Link>\n    </>\n  )\n}\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv13.0.0\tuseSearchParams introduced.\nPrevious\nuseRouter\nNext\nuseSelectedLayoutSegment\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

It gets used by the Next.js server and build phases, and it's not included in the browser build.\n\nIf you need ECMAScript modules\n, you can use next.config.mjs:\n\nnext.config.mjs\n// @ts-check\n \n/**\n * @type {import('next').NextConfig}\n */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  /* config options here */\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nGood to know: next.config with the .cjs, .cts, or .mts extensions are currently not supported.\n\nConfiguration as a Function\n\nYou can also use a function:\n\nnext.config.mjs\n// @ts-check\n \nexport default (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {\n  /**\n   * @type {import('next').NextConfig}\n   */\n  const nextConfig = {\n    /* config options here */\n  }\n  return nextConfig\n}\nAsync Configuration\n\nSince Next.js 12.1.0, you can use an async function:\n\nnext.config.js\n// @ts-check\n \nmodule.exports = async (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {\n  /**\n   * @type {import('next').NextConfig}\n   */\n  const nextConfig = {\n    /* config options here */\n  }\n  return nextConfig\n}\nPhase\n\nphase is the current context in which the configuration is loaded. You can see the available phases\n. Phases can be imported from next/constants:\n\nnext.config.js\n// @ts-check\n \nconst { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } = require('next/constants')\n \nmodule.exports = (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {\n  if (phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER) {\n    return {\n      /* development only config options here */\n    }\n  }\n \n  return {\n    /* config options for all phases except development here */\n  }\n}\nTypeScript\n\nIf you are using TypeScript in your project, you can use next.config.ts to use TypeScript in your configuration:\n\nnext.config.ts\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  /* config options here */\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nThe commented lines are the place where you can put the configs allowed by next.config.js, which are defined in this file\n.\n\nHowever, none of the configs are required, and it's not necessary to understand what each config does. Instead, search for the features you need to enable or modify in this section and they will show you what to do.\n\nAvoid using new JavaScript features not available in your target Node.js version. next.config.js will not be parsed by Webpack or Babel.\n\nThis page documents all the available configuration options:\n\nUnit Testing (experimental)\n\nStarting in Next.js 15.1, the next/experimental/testing/server package contains utilities to help unit test next.config.js files.\n\nThe unstable_getResponseFromNextConfig function runs the headers, redirects, and rewrites functions from next.config.js with the provided request information and returns NextResponse with the results of the routing.\n\nThe response from unstable_getResponseFromNextConfig only considers next.config.js fields and does not consider proxy or filesystem routes, so the result in production may be different than the unit test.\n\nimport {\n  getRedirectUrl,\n  unstable_getResponseFromNextConfig,\n} from 'next/experimental/testing/server'\n \nconst response = await unstable_getResponseFromNextConfig({\n  url: 'https://nextjs.org/test',\n  nextConfig: {\n    async redirects() {\n      return [{ source: '/test', destination: '/test2', permanent: false }]\n    },\n  },\n})\nexpect(response.status).toEqual(307)\nexpect(getRedirectUrl(response)).toEqual('https://nextjs.org/test2')\nexperimental.adapterPath\nConfigure a custom adapter for Next.js to hook into the build process with modifyConfig and onBuildComplete callbacks.\nallowedDevOrigins\nUse `allowedDevOrigins` to configure additional origins that can request the dev server.\nappDir\nEnable the App Router to use layouts, streaming, and more.\nassetPrefix\nLearn how to use the assetPrefix config option to configure your CDN.\nauthInterrupts\nLearn how to enable the experimental `authInterrupts` configuration option to use `forbidden` and `unauthorized`.\nbasePath\nUse `basePath` to deploy a Next.js application under a sub-path of a domain.\nbrowserDebugInfoInTerminal\nForward browser console logs and errors to your terminal during development.\ncacheComponents\nLearn how to enable the cacheComponents flag in Next.js.\ncacheLife\nLearn how to set up cacheLife configurations in Next.js.\ncompress\nNext.js provides gzip compression to compress rendered content and static files, it only works with the server target.

The only folder you need to host on your CDN is the contents of .next/static/, which should be uploaded as _next/static/ as the above URL request indicates. Do not upload the rest of your .next/ folder, as you should not expose your server code and other configuration to the public.\n\nWhile assetPrefix covers requests to _next/static, it does not influence the following paths:\n\nFiles in the public folder; if you want to serve those assets over a CDN, you'll have to introduce the prefix yourself\nPrevious\nappDir\nNext\nauthInterrupts\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

In development exportPathMap is used to define routes.\ndir - Absolute path to the project directory\noutDir - Absolute path to the out/ directory (configurable with -o). When dev is true the value of outDir will be null.\ndistDir - Absolute path to the .next/ directory (configurable with the distDir config)\nbuildId - The generated build id\n\nThe returned object is a map of pages where the key is the pathname and the value is an object that accepts the following fields:\n\npage: String - the page inside the pages directory to render\nquery: Object - the query object passed to getInitialProps when prerendering. Defaults to {}\n\nThe exported pathname can also be a filename (for example, /readme.md), but you may need to set the Content-Type header to text/html when serving its content if it is different than .html.\n\nAdding a trailing slash\n\nIt is possible to configure Next.js to export pages as index.html files and require trailing slashes, /about becomes /about/index.html and is routable via /about/. This was the default behavior prior to Next.js 9.\n\nTo switch back and add a trailing slash, open next.config.js and enable the trailingSlash config:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  trailingSlash: true,\n}\nCustomizing the output directory\n\nnext export will use out as the default output directory, you can customize this using the -o argument, like so:\n\nTerminal\nnext export -o outdir\n\nWarning: Using exportPathMap is deprecated and is overridden by getStaticPaths inside pages.

Using the below headers, the path /hello will result in the header x-hello being world due to the last header value set being world.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'there',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        source: '/hello',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nPath Matching\n\nPath matches are allowed, for example /blog/:slug will match /blog/hello-world (no nested paths):\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-slug',\n            value: ':slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the value\n          },\n          {\n            key: 'x-slug-:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the key\n            value: 'my other custom header value',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nWildcard Path Matching\n\nTo match a wildcard path you can use * after a parameter, for example /blog/:slug* will match /blog/a/b/c/d/hello-world:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug*',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-slug',\n            value: ':slug*', // Matched parameters can be used in the value\n          },\n          {\n            key: 'x-slug-:slug*', // Matched parameters can be used in the key\n            value: 'my other custom header value',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nRegex Path Matching\n\nTo match a regex path you can wrap the regex in parenthesis after a parameter, for example /blog/:slug(\\\\d{1,}) will match /blog/123 but not /blog/abc:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:post(\\\\d{1,})',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-post',\n            value: ':post',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n\nThe following characters (, ), {, }, :, *, +, ? are used for regex path matching, so when used in the source as non-special values they must be escaped by adding \\\\ before them:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        // this will match `/english(default)/something` being requested\n        source: '/english\\\\(default\\\\)/:slug',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-header',\n            value: 'value',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nHeader, Cookie, and Query Matching\n\nTo only apply a header when header, cookie, or query values also match the has field or don't match the missing field can be used. Both the source and all has items must match and all missing items must not match for the header to be applied.\n\nhas and missing items can have the following fields:\n\ntype: String - must be either header, cookie, host, or query.\nkey: String - the key from the selected type to match against.\nvalue: String or undefined - the value to check for, if undefined any value will match. A regex like string can be used to capture a specific part of the value, e.g. if the value first-(?<paramName>.*) is used for first-second then second will be usable in the destination with :paramName.\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      // if the header `x-add-header` is present,\n      // the `x-another-header` header will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-add-header',\n          },\n        ],\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-another-header',\n            value: 'hello',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      // if the header `x-no-header` is not present,\n      // the `x-another-header` header will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        missing: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-no-header',\n          },\n        ],\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-another-header',\n            value: 'hello',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      // if the source, query, and cookie are matched,\n      // the `x-authorized` header will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/specific/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'query',\n            key: 'page',\n            // the page value will not be available in the\n            // header key/values since value is provided and\n            // doesn't use a named capture group e.g. (?<page>home)\n            value: 'home',\n          },\n          {\n            type: 'cookie',\n            key: 'authorized',\n            value: 'true',\n          },\n        ],\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-authorized',\n            value: ':authorized',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      // if the header `x-authorized` is present and\n      // contains a matching value, the `x-another-header` will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-authorized',\n            value: '(?<authorized>yes|true)',\n          },\n        ],\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-another-header',\n            value: ':authorized',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      // if the host is `example.com`,\n      // this header will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'host',\n            value: 'example.com',\n          },\n        ],\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-another-header',\n            value: ':authorized',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nHeaders with basePath support\n\nWhen leveraging basePath support with headers each source is automatically prefixed with the basePath unless you add basePath: false to the header:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  basePath: '/docs',\n \n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/with-basePath', // becomes /docs/with-basePath\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        source: '/without-basePath', // is not modified since basePath: false is set\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n        basePath: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nHeaders with i18n support\n\nWhen leveraging i18n support with headers each source is automatically prefixed to handle the configured locales unless you add locale: false to the header. If locale: false is used you must prefix the source with a locale for it to be matched correctly.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en', 'fr', 'de'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n  },\n \n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/with-locale', // automatically handles all locales\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        // does not handle locales automatically since locale: false is set\n        source: '/nl/with-locale-manual',\n        locale: false,\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        // this matches '/' since `en` is the defaultLocale\n        source: '/en',\n        locale: false,\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        // this gets converted to /(en|fr|de)/(.*) so will not match the top-level\n        // `/` or `/fr` routes like /:path* would\n        source: '/(.*)',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nCache-Control\n\nNext.js sets the Cache-Control header of public, max-age=31536000, immutable for truly immutable assets. It cannot be overridden. These immutable files contain a SHA-hash in the file name, so they can be safely cached indefinitely. For example, Static Image Imports. You cannot set Cache-Control headers in next.config.js for these assets.\n\nHowever, you can set Cache-Control headers for other responses or data.\n\nLearn more about caching with the App Router.\n\nOptions\nCORS\n\nCross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)\n is a security feature that allows you to control which sites can access your resources. You can set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to allow a specific origin to access your Route Handlers.\n\nasync headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: \"/api/:path*\",\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\",\n            value: \"*\", // Set your origin\n          },\n          {\n            key: \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\",\n            value: \"GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS\",\n          },\n          {\n            key: \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\",\n            value: \"Content-Type, Authorization\",\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ];\n  },\nX-DNS-Prefetch-Control\n\nThis header\n controls DNS prefetching, allowing browsers to proactively perform domain name resolution on external links, images, CSS, JavaScript, and more. This prefetching is performed in the background, so the DNS\n is more likely to be resolved by the time the referenced items are needed. This reduces latency when the user clicks a link.\n\n{\n  key: 'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control',\n  value: 'on'\n}\nStrict-Transport-Security\n\nThis header\n informs browsers it should only be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. Using the configuration below, all present and future subdomains will use HTTPS for a max-age of 2 years. This blocks access to pages or subdomains that can only be served over HTTP.\n\n{\n  key: 'Strict-Transport-Security',\n  value: 'max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload'\n}\nX-Frame-Options\n\nThis header\n indicates whether the site should be allowed to be displayed within an iframe. This can prevent against clickjacking attacks.\n\nThis header has been superseded by CSP's frame-ancestors option, which has better support in modern browsers (see Content Security Policy for configuration details).\n\n{\n  key: 'X-Frame-Options',\n  value: 'SAMEORIGIN'\n}\nPermissions-Policy\n\nThis header\n allows you to control which features and APIs can be used in the browser. It was previously named Feature-Policy.\n\n{\n  key: 'Permissions-Policy',\n  value: 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), browsing-topics=()'\n}\nX-Content-Type-Options\n\nThis header\n prevents the browser from attempting to guess the type of content if the Content-Type header is not explicitly set. This can prevent XSS exploits for websites that allow users to upload and share files.\n\nFor example, a user trying to download an image, but having it treated as a different Content-Type like an executable, which could be malicious. This header also applies to downloading browser extensions. The only valid value for this header is nosniff.\n\n{\n  key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',\n  value: 'nosniff'\n}\nReferrer-Policy\n\nThis header\n controls how much information the browser includes when navigating from the current website (origin) to another.\n\n{\n  key: 'Referrer-Policy',\n  value: 'origin-when-cross-origin'\n}\nContent-Security-Policy\n\nLearn more about adding a Content Security Policy to your application.\n\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv13.3.0\tmissing added.\nv10.2.0\thas added.\nv9.5.0\tHeaders added.\nPrevious\ngenerateEtags\nNext\nhtmlLimitedBots\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

This makes inlining a compelling choice because the entire set of styles for the current page is lightweight and doesn’t grow with the page size. Inlining Tailwind styles ensures minimal payload and eliminates the need for additional network requests, which can further enhance performance.\n\nWhen Not to Use Inline CSS\n\nWhile inlining CSS offers significant benefits for performance, there are scenarios where it may not be the best choice:\n\nLarge CSS Bundles: If your CSS bundle is too large, inlining it may significantly increase the size of the HTML, resulting in slower Time to First Byte (TTFB) and potentially worse performance for users with slow connections.\n\nDynamic or Page-Specific CSS: For applications with highly dynamic styles or pages that use different sets of CSS, inlining may lead to redundancy and bloat, as the full CSS for all pages may need to be inlined repeatedly.\n\nBrowser Caching: In cases where visitors frequently return to your site, external CSS files allow browsers to cache styles efficiently, reducing data transfer for subsequent visits. Inlining CSS eliminates this benefit.\n\nEvaluate these trade-offs carefully, and consider combining inlining with other strategies, such as critical CSS extraction or a hybrid approach, for the best results tailored to your site's needs.\n\nGood to know:\n\nThis feature is currently experimental and has some known limitations:\n\nCSS inlining is applied globally and cannot be configured on a per-page basis\nStyles are duplicated during initial page load - once within <style> tags for SSR and once in the RSC payload\nWhen navigating to statically rendered pages, styles will use <link> tags instead of inline CSS to avoid duplication\nThis feature is not available in development mode and only works in production builds\nPrevious\ncacheHandler\nNext\nisolatedDevBuild\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

    "html": "Configuration\nnext.config.js\noutput\nCopy page\noutput\n\nDuring a build, Next.js will automatically trace each page and its dependencies to determine all of the files that are needed for deploying a production version of your application.\n\nThis feature helps reduce the size of deployments drastically. Previously, when deploying with Docker you would need to have all files from your package's dependencies installed to run next start. Starting with Next.js 12, you can leverage Output File Tracing in the .next/ directory to only include the necessary files.\n\nFurthermore, this removes the need for the deprecated serverless target which can cause various issues and also creates unnecessary duplication.\n\nHow it Works\n\nDuring next build, Next.js will use @vercel/nft\n to statically analyze import, require, and fs usage to determine all files that a page might load.\n\nNext.js' production server is also traced for its needed files and output at .next/next-server.js.nft.json which can be leveraged in production.\n\nTo leverage the .nft.json files emitted to the .next output directory, you can read the list of files in each trace that are relative to the .nft.json file and then copy them to your deployment location.\n\nAutomatically Copying Traced Files\n\nNext.js can automatically create a standalone folder that copies only the necessary files for a production deployment including select files in node_modules.\n\nTo leverage this automatic copying you can enable it in your next.config.js:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  output: 'standalone',\n}\n\nThis will create a folder at .next/standalone which can then be deployed on its own without installing node_modules.\n\nAdditionally, a minimal server.js file is also output which can be used instead of next start. This minimal server does not copy the public or .next/static folders by default as these should ideally be handled by a CDN instead, although these folders can be copied to the standalone/public and standalone/.next/static folders manually, after which server.js file will serve these automatically.\n\nTo copy these manually, you can use the cp command-line tool after you next build:\n\nTerminal\ncp -r public .next/standalone/ && cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/.next/\n\nTo start your minimal server.js file locally, run the following command:\n\nTerminal\nnode .next/standalone/server.js\n\nGood to know:\n\nIf your project needs to listen to a specific port or hostname, you can define PORT or HOSTNAME environment variables before running server.js. For example, run PORT=8080 HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 node server.js to start the server on http://0.0.0.0:8080.\nCaveats\nWhile tracing in monorepo setups, the project directory is used for tracing by default. For next build packages/web-app, packages/web-app would be the tracing root and any files outside of that folder will not be included. To include files outside of this folder you can set outputFileTracingRoot in your next.config.js.\npackages/web-app/next.config.js\nconst path = require('path')\n \nmodule.exports = {\n  // this includes files from the monorepo base two directories up\n  outputFileTracingRoot: path.join(__dirname, '../../'),\n}\nThere are some cases in which Next.js might fail to include required files, or might incorrectly include unused files. In those cases, you can leverage outputFileTracingExcludes and outputFileTracingIncludes respectively in next.config.js. Each option accepts an object whose keys are route globs (matched with picomatch\n against the route path, e.g. /api/hello) and whose values are glob patterns resolved from the project root that specify files to include or exclude in the trace.\n\nGood to know: In a monorepo, project root refers to the Next.js project root (the folder containing next.config.js, e.g., packages/web-app), not necessarily the monorepo root.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  outputFileTracingExcludes: {\n    '/api/hello': ['./un-necessary-folder/**/*'],\n  },\n  outputFileTracingIncludes: {\n    '/api/another': ['./necessary-folder/**/*'],\n    '/api/login/\\\\[\\\\[\\\\.\\\\.\\\\.slug\\\\]\\\\]': [\n      './node_modules/aws-crt/dist/bin/**/*',\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nUsing a src/ directory does not change how you write these options:\n\nKeys still match the route path ('/api/hello', '/products/[id]', etc.).\nValues can reference paths under src/ since they are resolved relative to the project root.\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  outputFileTracingIncludes: {\n    '/products/*': ['src/lib/payments/**/*'],\n    '/*': ['src/config/runtime/**/*.json'],\n  },\n  outputFileTracingExcludes: {\n    '/api/*': ['src/temp/**/*', 'public/large-logs/**/*'],\n  },\n}\n\nYou can also target all routes using a global key like '/*':\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  outputFileTracingIncludes: {\n    '/*': ['src/i18n/locales/**/*.json'],\n  },\n}\n\nThese options are applied to server traces and do not affect routes that do not produce a server trace file:\n\nEdge Runtime routes are not affected.\nFully static pages are not affected.\n\nIn monorepos or when you need to include files outside the app folder, combine outputFileTracingRoot with includes:\n\nnext.config.js\nconst path = require('path')\n \nmodule.exports = {\n  // Trace from the monorepo root\n  outputFileTracingRoot: path.join(__dirname, '../../'),\n  outputFileTracingIncludes: {\n    '/route1': ['../shared/assets/**/*'],\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know:\n\nPrefer forward slashes (/) in patterns for cross-platform compatibility.\nKeep patterns as narrow as possible to avoid oversized traces (avoid **/* at the repo root).\n\nCommon include patterns for native/runtime assets:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  outputFileTracingIncludes: {\n    '/*': ['node_modules/sharp/**/*', 'node_modules/aws-crt/dist/bin/**/*'],\n  },\n}\nPrevious\noptimizePackageImports\nNext\npageExtensions\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

Try it out and share your feedback on GitHub.\n\nWhen proxy is used, Next.js automatically clones the request body and buffers it in memory to enable multiple reads - both in proxy and the underlying route handler. To prevent excessive memory usage, this configuration option sets a size limit on the buffered body.\n\nBy default, the maximum body size is 10MB. If a request body exceeds this limit, the body will only be buffered up to the limit, and a warning will be logged indicating which route exceeded the limit.\n\nOptions\nString format (recommended)\n\nSpecify the size using a human-readable string format:\n\nnext.config.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  experimental: {\n    proxyClientMaxBodySize: '1mb',\n  },\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nSupported units: b, kb, mb, gb\n\nNumber format\n\nAlternatively, specify the size in bytes as a number:\n\nnext.config.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  experimental: {\n    proxyClientMaxBodySize: 1048576, // 1MB in bytes\n  },\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\nBehavior\n\nWhen a request body exceeds the configured limit:\n\nNext.js will buffer only the first N bytes (up to the limit)\nA warning will be logged to the console indicating the route that exceeded the limit\nThe request will continue processing normally, but only the partial body will be available\nThe request will not fail or return an error to the client\n\nIf your application needs to process the full request body, you should either:\n\nIncrease the proxyClientMaxBodySize limit\nHandle the partial body gracefully in your application logic\nExample\nproxy.ts\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nexport async function proxy(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Next.js automatically buffers the body with the configured size limit\n  // You can read the body in proxy...\n  const body = await request.text()\n \n  // If the body exceeded the limit, only partial data will be available\n  console.log('Body size:', body.length)\n \n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\napp/api/upload/route.ts\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nexport async function POST(request: NextRequest) {\n  // ...and the body is still available in your route handler\n  const body = await request.text()\n \n  console.log('Body in route handler:', body.length)\n \n  return NextResponse.json({ received: body.length })\n}\nGood to know\nThis setting only applies when proxy is used in your application\nThe default limit of 10MB is designed to balance memory usage and typical use cases\nThe limit applies per-request, not globally across all concurrent requests\nFor applications handling large file uploads, consider increasing the limit accordingly\nPrevious\nproductionBrowserSourceMaps\nNext\nreactCompiler\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

This reduces the need for manual memoization using useMemo and useCallback.\n\nNext.js includes a custom performance optimization written in SWC that makes the React Compiler more efficient. Instead of running the compiler on every file, Next.js analyzes your project and only applies the React Compiler to relevant files. This avoids unnecessary work and leads to faster builds compared to using the Babel plugin on its own.\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe React Compiler runs through a Babel plugin. To keep builds fast, Next.js uses a custom SWC optimization that only applies the React Compiler to relevant files—like those with JSX or React Hooks.\n\nThis avoids compiling everything and keeps the performance cost minimal. You may still see slightly slower builds compared to the default Rust-based compiler, but the impact is small and localized.\n\nTo use it, install the babel-plugin-react-compiler:\n\nTerminal\nnpm install -D babel-plugin-react-compiler\n\nThen, add reactCompiler option in next.config.js:\n\nnext.config.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  reactCompiler: true,\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\nAnnotations\n\nYou can configure the compiler to run in \"opt-in\" mode as follows:\n\nnext.config.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  reactCompiler: {\n    compilationMode: 'annotation',\n  },\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nThen, you can annotate specific components or hooks with the \"use memo\" directive from React to opt-in:\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nexport default function Page() {\n  'use memo'\n  // ...\n}\n\nNote: You can also use the \"use no memo\" directive from React for the opposite effect, to opt-out a component or hook.\n\nPrevious\nproxyClientMaxBodySize\nNext\nreactMaxHeadersLength\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

    "html": "Configuration\nnext.config.js\nredirects\nCopy page\nredirects\n\nRedirects allow you to redirect an incoming request path to a different destination path.\n\nTo use redirects you can use the redirects key in next.config.js:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/about',\n        destination: '/',\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n\nredirects is an async function that expects an array to be returned holding objects with source, destination, and permanent properties:\n\nsource is the incoming request path pattern.\ndestination is the path you want to route to.\npermanent true or false - if true will use the 308 status code which instructs clients/search engines to cache the redirect forever, if false will use the 307 status code which is temporary and is not cached.\n\nWhy does Next.js use 307 and 308? Traditionally a 302 was used for a temporary redirect, and a 301 for a permanent redirect, but many browsers changed the request method of the redirect to GET, regardless of the original method. For example, if the browser made a request to POST /v1/users which returned status code 302 with location /v2/users, the subsequent request might be GET /v2/users instead of the expected POST /v2/users. Next.js uses the 307 temporary redirect, and 308 permanent redirect status codes to explicitly preserve the request method used.\n\nbasePath: false or undefined - if false the basePath won't be included when matching, can be used for external redirects only.\nlocale: false or undefined - whether the locale should not be included when matching.\nhas is an array of has objects with the type, key and value properties.\nmissing is an array of missing objects with the type, key and value properties.\n\nRedirects are checked before the filesystem which includes pages and /public files.\n\nWhen using the Pages Router, redirects are not applied to client-side routing (Link, router.push) unless Proxy is present and matches the path.\n\nWhen a redirect is applied, any query values provided in the request will be passed through to the redirect destination. For example, see the following redirect configuration:\n\n{\n  source: '/old-blog/:path*',\n  destination: '/blog/:path*',\n  permanent: false\n}\n\nGood to know: Remember to include the forward slash / before the colon : in path parameters of the source and destination paths, otherwise the path will be treated as a literal string and you run the risk of causing infinite redirects.\n\nWhen /old-blog/post-1?hello=world is requested, the client will be redirected to /blog/post-1?hello=world.\n\nPath Matching\n\nPath matches are allowed, for example /old-blog/:slug will match /old-blog/hello-world (no nested paths):\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/old-blog/:slug',\n        destination: '/news/:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nWildcard Path Matching\n\nTo match a wildcard path you can use * after a parameter, for example /blog/:slug* will match /blog/a/b/c/d/hello-world:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug*',\n        destination: '/news/:slug*', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nRegex Path Matching\n\nTo match a regex path you can wrap the regex in parentheses after a parameter, for example /post/:slug(\\\\d{1,}) will match /post/123 but not /post/abc:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/post/:slug(\\\\d{1,})',\n        destination: '/news/:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n\nThe following characters (, ), {, }, :, *, +, ? are used for regex path matching, so when used in the source as non-special values they must be escaped by adding \\\\ before them:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        // this will match `/english(default)/something` being requested\n        source: '/english\\\\(default\\\\)/:slug',\n        destination: '/en-us/:slug',\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nHeader, Cookie, and Query Matching\n\nTo only match a redirect when header, cookie, or query values also match the has field or don't match the missing field can be used. Both the source and all has items must match and all missing items must not match for the redirect to be applied.\n\nhas and missing items can have the following fields:\n\ntype: String - must be either header, cookie, host, or query.\nkey: String - the key from the selected type to match against.\nvalue: String or undefined - the value to check for, if undefined any value will match. A regex like string can be used to capture a specific part of the value, e.g. if the value first-(?<paramName>.*) is used for first-second then second will be usable in the destination with :paramName.\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      // if the header `x-redirect-me` is present,\n      // this redirect will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path((?!another-page$).*)',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-redirect-me',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n      // if the header `x-dont-redirect` is present,\n      // this redirect will NOT be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path((?!another-page$).*)',\n        missing: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-do-not-redirect',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n      // if the source, query, and cookie are matched,\n      // this redirect will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/specific/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'query',\n            key: 'page',\n            // the page value will not be available in the\n            // destination since value is provided and doesn't\n            // use a named capture group e.g. (?<page>home)\n            value: 'home',\n          },\n          {\n            type: 'cookie',\n            key: 'authorized',\n            value: 'true',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/another/:path*',\n      },\n      // if the header `x-authorized` is present and\n      // contains a matching value, this redirect will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-authorized',\n            value: '(?<authorized>yes|true)',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/home?authorized=:authorized',\n      },\n      // if the host is `example.com`,\n      // this redirect will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path((?!another-page$).*)',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'host',\n            value: 'example.com',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nRedirects with basePath support\n\nWhen leveraging basePath support with redirects each source and destination is automatically prefixed with the basePath unless you add basePath: false to the redirect:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  basePath: '/docs',\n \n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/with-basePath', // automatically becomes /docs/with-basePath\n        destination: '/another', // automatically becomes /docs/another\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // does not add /docs since basePath: false is set\n        source: '/without-basePath',\n        destination: 'https://example.com',\n        basePath: false,\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nRedirects with i18n support\n\nWhen implementing redirects with internationalization in the App Router, you can include locales in next.config.js redirects, but only as hardcoded paths.\n\nFor dynamic or per-request locale handling, use dynamic route segments and proxy, which can redirect based on the user's preferred language.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        // Manually handle locale prefixes for App Router\n        source: '/en/old-path',\n        destination: '/en/new-path',\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // Redirect for all locales using a parameter\n        source: '/:locale/old-path',\n        destination: '/:locale/new-path',\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // Redirect from one locale to another\n        source: '/de/old-path',\n        destination: '/en/new-path',\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // Catch-all redirect for multiple locales\n        source: '/:locale(en|fr|de)/:path*',\n        destination: '/:locale/new-section/:path*',\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n\nIn some rare cases, you might need to assign a custom status code for older HTTP Clients to properly redirect. In these cases, you can use the statusCode property instead of the permanent property, but not both. To ensure IE11 compatibility, a Refresh header is automatically added for the 308 status code.\n\nOther Redirects\nInside API Routes and Route Handlers, you can redirect based on the incoming request.\nInside getStaticProps and getServerSideProps, you can redirect specific pages at request-time.\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv13.3.0\tmissing added.\nv10.2.0\thas added.\nv9.5.0\tredirects added.\nPrevious\nreactStrictMode\nNext\nrewrites\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

If you use fallback: true/'blocking' in getStaticPaths, the fallback rewrites defined in your next.config.js will not be run.\nRewrite parameters\n\nWhen using parameters in a rewrite the parameters will be passed in the query by default when none of the parameters are used in the destination.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/old-about/:path*',\n        destination: '/about', // The :path parameter isn't used here so will be automatically passed in the query\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n\nIf a parameter is used in the destination none of the parameters will be automatically passed in the query.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/docs/:path*',\n        destination: '/:path*', // The :path parameter is used here so will not be automatically passed in the query\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n\nYou can still pass the parameters manually in the query if one is already used in the destination by specifying the query in the destination.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/:first/:second',\n        destination: '/:first?second=:second',\n        // Since the :first parameter is used in the destination the :second parameter\n        // will not automatically be added in the query although we can manually add it\n        // as shown above\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: Static pages from Automatic Static Optimization or prerendering params from rewrites will be parsed on the client after hydration and provided in the query.\n\nPath Matching\n\nPath matches are allowed, for example /blog/:slug will match /blog/hello-world (no nested paths):\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug',\n        destination: '/news/:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nWildcard Path Matching\n\nTo match a wildcard path you can use * after a parameter, for example /blog/:slug* will match /blog/a/b/c/d/hello-world:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug*',\n        destination: '/news/:slug*', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nRegex Path Matching\n\nTo match a regex path you can wrap the regex in parenthesis after a parameter, for example /blog/:slug(\\\\d{1,}) will match /blog/123 but not /blog/abc:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/old-blog/:post(\\\\d{1,})',\n        destination: '/blog/:post', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n\nThe following characters (, ), {, }, [, ], |, \\, ^, ., :, *, +, -, ?, $ are used for regex path matching, so when used in the source as non-special values they must be escaped by adding \\\\ before them:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        // this will match `/english(default)/something` being requested\n        source: '/english\\\\(default\\\\)/:slug',\n        destination: '/en-us/:slug',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nHeader, Cookie, and Query Matching\n\nTo only match a rewrite when header, cookie, or query values also match the has field or don't match the missing field can be used. Both the source and all has items must match and all missing items must not match for the rewrite to be applied.\n\nhas and missing items can have the following fields:\n\ntype: String - must be either header, cookie, host, or query.\nkey: String - the key from the selected type to match against.\nvalue: String or undefined - the value to check for, if undefined any value will match. A regex like string can be used to capture a specific part of the value, e.g. if the value first-(?<paramName>.*) is used for first-second then second will be usable in the destination with :paramName.\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      // if the header `x-rewrite-me` is present,\n      // this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-rewrite-me',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n      // if the header `x-rewrite-me` is not present,\n      // this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        missing: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-rewrite-me',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n      // if the source, query, and cookie are matched,\n      // this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/specific/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'query',\n            key: 'page',\n            // the page value will not be available in the\n            // destination since value is provided and doesn't\n            // use a named capture group e.g. (?<page>home)\n            value: 'home',\n          },\n          {\n            type: 'cookie',\n            key: 'authorized',\n            value: 'true',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/:path*/home',\n      },\n      // if the header `x-authorized` is present and\n      // contains a matching value, this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-authorized',\n            value: '(?<authorized>yes|true)',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/home?authorized=:authorized',\n      },\n      // if the host is `example.com`,\n      // this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'host',\n            value: 'example.com',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nRewriting to an external URL\nExamples\n\nRewrites allow you to rewrite to an external URL. This is especially useful for incrementally adopting Next.js. The following is an example rewrite for redirecting the /blog route of your main app to an external site.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog',\n        destination: 'https://example.com/blog',\n      },\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug',\n        destination: 'https://example.com/blog/:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n\nIf you're using trailingSlash: true, you also need to insert a trailing slash in the source parameter. If the destination server is also expecting a trailing slash it should be included in the destination parameter as well.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  trailingSlash: true,\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/',\n        destination: 'https://example.com/blog/',\n      },\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:path*/',\n        destination: 'https://example.com/blog/:path*/',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nIncremental adoption of Next.js\n\nYou can also have Next.js fall back to proxying to an existing website after checking all Next.js routes.\n\nThis way you don't have to change the rewrites configuration when migrating more pages to Next.js\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return {\n      fallback: [\n        {\n          source: '/:path*',\n          destination: `https://custom-routes-proxying-endpoint.vercel.app/:path*`,\n        },\n      ],\n    }\n  },\n}\nRewrites with basePath support\n\nWhen leveraging basePath support with rewrites each source and destination is automatically prefixed with the basePath unless you add basePath: false to the rewrite:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  basePath: '/docs',\n \n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/with-basePath', // automatically becomes /docs/with-basePath\n        destination: '/another', // automatically becomes /docs/another\n      },\n      {\n        // does not add /docs to /without-basePath since basePath: false is set\n        // Note: this can not be used for internal rewrites e.g. `destination: '/another'`\n        source: '/without-basePath',\n        destination: 'https://example.com',\n        basePath: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\nv13.3.0\tmissing added.\nv10.2.0\thas added.\nv9.5.0\tHeaders added.\nPrevious\nredirects\nNext\nsassOptions\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

Try it out and share your feedback on GitHub.\nUsage\n\nThe taint option enables support for experimental React APIs for tainting objects and values. This feature helps prevent sensitive data from being accidentally passed to the client. When enabled, you can use:\n\nexperimental_taintObjectReference\n taint objects references.\nexperimental_taintUniqueValue\n to taint unique values.\n\nGood to know: Activating this flag also enables the React experimental channel for app directory.\n\nnext.config.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  experimental: {\n    taint: true,\n  },\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nWarning: Do not rely on the taint API as your only mechanism to prevent exposing sensitive data to the client. See our security recommendations.\n\nThe taint APIs allows you to be defensive, by declaratively and explicitly marking data that is not allowed to pass through the Server-Client boundary. When an object or value, is passed through the Server-Client boundary, React throws an error.\n\nThis is helpful for cases where:\n\nThe methods to read data are out of your control\nYou have to work with sensitive data shapes not defined by you\nSensitive data is accessed during Server Component rendering\n\nIt is recommended to model your data and APIs so that sensitive data is not returned to contexts where it is not needed.\n\nCaveats\nTainting can only keep track of objects by reference. Copying an object creates an untainted version, which loses all guarantees given by the API. You'll need to taint the copy.\nTainting cannot keep track of data derived from a tainted value. You also need to taint the derived value.\nValues are tainted for as long as their lifetime reference is within scope. See the experimental_taintUniqueValue parameters reference\n, for more information.\nExamples\nTainting an object reference\n\nIn this case, the getUserDetails function returns data about a given user. We taint the user object reference, so that it cannot cross a Server-Client boundary. For example, assuming UserCard is a Client Component.\n\nimport { experimental_taintObjectReference } from 'react'\n \nfunction getUserDetails(id: string): UserDetails {\n  const user = await db.queryUserById(id)\n \n  experimental_taintObjectReference(\n    'Do not use the entire user info object. Instead, select only the fields you need.',\n    user\n  )\n \n  return user\n}\n\nWe can still access individual fields from the tainted userDetails object.\n\nexport async function ContactPage({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ id: string }>\n}) {\n  const { id } = await params\n  const userDetails = await getUserDetails(id)\n \n  return (\n    <UserCard\n      firstName={userDetails.firstName}\n      lastName={userDetails.lastName}\n    />\n  )\n}\n\nNow, passing the entire object to the Client Component will throw an error.\n\nexport async function ContactPage({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ id: string }>\n}) {\n  const userDetails = await getUserDetails(id)\n \n  // Throws an error\n  return <UserCard user={userDetails} />\n}\nTainting a unique value\n\nIn this case, we can access the server configuration by awaiting calls to config.getConfigDetails. However, the system configuration contains the SERVICE_API_KEY that we don't want to expose to clients.\n\nWe can taint the config.SERVICE_API_KEY value.\n\nimport { experimental_taintUniqueValue } from 'react'\n \nfunction getSystemConfig(): SystemConfig {\n  const config = await config.getConfigDetails()\n \n  experimental_taintUniqueValue(\n    'Do not pass configuration tokens to the client',\n    config,\n    config.SERVICE_API_KEY\n  )\n \n  return config\n}\n\nWe can still access other properties of the systemConfig object.\n\nexport async function Dashboard() {\n  const systemConfig = await getSystemConfig()\n \n  return <ClientDashboard version={systemConfig.SERVICE_API_VERSION} />\n}\n\nHowever, passing SERVICE_API_KEY to ClientDashboard throws an error.\n\nexport async function Dashboard() {\n  const systemConfig = await getSystemConfig()\n  // Someone makes a mistake in a PR\n  const version = systemConfig.SERVICE_API_KEY\n \n  return <ClientDashboard version={version} />\n}\n\nNote that, even though, systemConfig.SERVICE_API_KEY is reassigned to a new variable. Passing it to a Client Component still throws an error.\n\nWhereas, a value derived from a tainted unique value, will be exposed to the client.\n\nexport async function Dashboard() {\n  const systemConfig = await getSystemConfig()\n  // Someone makes a mistake in a PR\n  const version = `version::${systemConfig.SERVICE_API_KEY}`\n \n  return <ClientDashboard version={version} />\n}\n\nA better approach is to remove SERVICE_API_KEY from the data returned by getSystemConfig.\n\nPrevious\nstaticGeneration*\nNext\ntrailingSlash\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

Turbopack has built-in support for CSS and compiling modern JavaScript, so there's no need for css-loader, postcss-loader, or babel-loader if you're using @babel/preset-env.\nReference\nOptions\n\nThe following options are available for the turbopack configuration:\n\nOption\tDescription\nroot\tSets the application root directory.

However, some features are not supported:\n\nModule loading:\n\nimportModule\n - No support\nloadModule\n - No support\n\nFile system and output:\n\nfs\n - Partial support: only fs.readFile is currently implemented.\nemitFile\n - No support\n\nContext properties:\n\nversion\n - No support\nmode\n - No support\ntarget\n - No support\n\nUtilities:\n\nutils\n - No support\nresolve\n - No support (use getResolve\n instead)\n\nIf you have a loader that is critically dependent upon one of these features please file an issue.\n\nExamples\nRoot directory\n\nTurbopack uses the root directory to resolve modules. Files outside of the project root are not resolved.\n\nNext.js automatically detects the root directory of your project. It does so by looking for one of these files:\n\npnpm-lock.yaml\npackage-lock.json\nyarn.lock\nbun.lock\nbun.lockb\n\nIf you have a different project structure, for example if you don't use workspaces, you can manually set the root option:\n\nnext.config.js\nconst path = require('path')\nmodule.exports = {\n  turbopack: {\n    root: path.join(__dirname, '..'),\n  },\n}\nConfiguring webpack loaders\n\nIf you need loader support beyond what's built in, many webpack loaders already work with Turbopack. There are currently some limitations:\n\nOnly a core subset of the webpack loader API is implemented. Currently, there is enough coverage for some popular loaders, and we'll expand our API support in the future.\nOnly loaders that return JavaScript code are supported. Loaders that transform files like stylesheets or images are not currently supported.\nOptions passed to webpack loaders must be plain JavaScript primitives, objects, and arrays. For example, it's not possible to pass require() plugin modules as option values.\n\nTo configure loaders, add the names of the loaders you've installed and any options in next.config.js, mapping file extensions to a list of loaders. Rules are evaluated in order.\n\nHere is an example below using the @svgr/webpack\n loader, which enables importing .svg files and rendering them as React components.\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  turbopack: {\n    rules: {\n      '*.svg': {\n        loaders: ['@svgr/webpack'],\n        as: '*.js',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: Globs used in the rules object match based on file name, unless the glob contains a / character, which will cause it to match based on the full project-relative file path. Windows file paths are normalized to use unix-style / path separators.\n\nTurbopack uses a modified version of the Rust globset library\n.\n\nFor loaders that require configuration options, you can use an object format instead of a string:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  turbopack: {\n    rules: {\n      '*.svg': {\n        loaders: [\n          {\n            loader: '@svgr/webpack',\n            options: {\n              icon: true,\n            },\n          },\n        ],\n        as: '*.js',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: Prior to Next.js version 13.4.4, turbopack.rules was named turbo.loaders and only accepted file extensions like .mdx instead of *.mdx.\n\nAdvanced webpack loader conditions\n\nYou can further restrict where a loader runs using the advanced condition syntax:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  turbopack: {\n    rules: {\n      // '*' will match all file paths, but we restrict where our\n      // rule runs with a condition.\n      '*': {\n        condition: {\n          all: [\n            // 'foreign' is a built-in condition.\n            { not: 'foreign' },\n            // 'path' can be a RegExp or a glob string. A RegExp matches\n            // anywhere in the full project-relative file path.\n            { path: /^img\\/[0-9]{3}\\// },\n            {\n              any: [\n                { path: '*.svg' },\n                // 'content' is always a RegExp, and can match\n                // anywhere in the file.\n                { content: /\\<svg\\W/ },\n              ],\n            },\n          ],\n        },\n        loaders: ['@svgr/webpack'],\n        as: '*.js',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\nSupported boolean operators are {all: [...]}, {any: [...]} and {not: ...}.\nSupported customizable operators are {path: string | RegExp} and {content: RegExp}. If path and content are specified in the same object, it acts as an implicit and.\n\nIn addition, a number of built-in conditions are supported:\n\nbrowser: Matches code that will execute on the client. Server code can be matched using {not: 'browser'}.\nforeign: Matches code in node_modules, as well as some Next.js internals. Usually you'll want to restrict loaders to {not: 'foreign'}. This can improve performance by reducing the number of files the loader is invoked on.\ndevelopment: Matches when using next dev.\nproduction: Matches when using next build.\nnode: Matches code that will run on the default Node.js runtime.\nedge-light: Matches code that will run on the Edge runtime.\n\nRules can be an object or an array of objects. An array is often useful for modeling disjoint conditions:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  turbopack: {\n    rules: {\n      '*.svg': [\n        {\n          condition: 'browser',\n          loaders: ['@svgr/webpack'],\n          as: '*.js',\n        },\n        {\n          condition: { not: 'browser' },\n          loaders: [require.resolve('./custom-svg-loader.js')],\n          as: '*.js',\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nGood to know: All matching rules are executed in order.\n\nResolving aliases\n\nTurbopack can be configured to modify module resolution through aliases, similar to webpack's resolve.alias\n configuration.\n\nTo configure resolve aliases, map imported patterns to their new destination in next.config.js:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  turbopack: {\n    resolveAlias: {\n      underscore: 'lodash',\n      mocha: { browser: 'mocha/browser-entry.js' },\n    },\n  },\n}\n\nThis aliases imports of the underscore package to the lodash package. In other words, import underscore from 'underscore' will load the lodash module instead of underscore.\n\nTurbopack also supports conditional aliasing through this field, similar to Node.js' conditional exports\n. At the moment only the browser condition is supported. In the case above, imports of the mocha module will be aliased to mocha/browser-entry.js when Turbopack targets browser environments.\n\nResolving custom extensions\n\nTurbopack can be configured to resolve modules with custom extensions, similar to webpack's resolve.extensions\n configuration.\n\nTo configure resolve extensions, use the resolveExtensions field in next.config.js:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  turbopack: {\n    resolveExtensions: ['.mdx', '.tsx', '.ts', '.jsx', '.js', '.mjs', '.json'],\n  },\n}\n\nThis overwrites the original resolve extensions with the provided list. Make sure to include the default extensions.\n\nFor more information and guidance for how to migrate your app to Turbopack from webpack, see Turbopack's documentation on webpack compatibility\n.\n\nDebug IDs\n\nTurbopack can be configured to generate debug IDs\n in JavaScript bundles and source maps.\n\nTo configure debug IDs, use the debugIds field in next.config.js:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  turbopack: {\n    debugIds: true,\n  },\n}\n\nThe option automatically adds a polyfill for debug IDs to the JavaScript bundle to ensure compatibility. The debug IDs are available in the globalThis._debugIds global variable.\n\nVersion History\nVersion\tChanges\n16.0.0\tturbopack.debugIds was added.\n16.0.0\tturbopack.rules.*.condition was added.\n15.3.0\texperimental.turbo is changed to turbopack.\n13.0.0\texperimental.turbo introduced.\nPrevious\ntranspilePackages\nNext\nturbopackFileSystemCache\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

To start, we added an experimental flag forcing you to explicitly allow the domains you accept URL imports from. We're working to take this further by limiting URL imports to execute in the browser sandbox using the Edge Runtime.\n\nLockfile\n\nWhen using URL imports, Next.js will create a next.lock directory containing a lockfile and fetched assets. This directory must be committed to Git, not ignored by .gitignore.\n\nWhen running next dev, Next.js will download and add all newly discovered URL Imports to your lockfile.\nWhen running next build, Next.js will use only the lockfile to build the application for production.\n\nTypically, no network requests are needed and any outdated lockfile will cause the build to fail. One exception is resources that respond with Cache-Control: no-cache.

    "html": "API Reference\nConfiguration\nTypeScript\nCopy page\nTypeScript\n\nNext.js comes with built-in TypeScript, automatically installing the necessary packages and configuring the proper settings when you create a new project with create-next-app.\n\nTo add TypeScript to an existing project, rename a file to .ts / .tsx. Run next dev and next build to automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a tsconfig.json file with the recommended config options.\n\nGood to know: If you already have a jsconfig.json file, copy the paths compiler option from the old jsconfig.json into the new tsconfig.json file, and delete the old jsconfig.json file.\n\nIDE Plugin\n\nNext.js includes a custom TypeScript plugin and type checker, which VSCode and other code editors can use for advanced type-checking and auto-completion.\n\nYou can enable the plugin in VS Code by:\n\nOpening the command palette (Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + P)\nSearching for \"TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version\"\nSelecting \"Use Workspace Version\"\n\nNow, when editing files, the custom plugin will be enabled. When running next build, the custom type checker will be used.\n\nThe TypeScript plugin can help with:\n\nWarning if the invalid values for segment config options are passed.\nShowing available options and in-context documentation.\nEnsuring the 'use client' directive is used correctly.\nEnsuring client hooks (like useState) are only used in Client Components.\n\n🎥 Watch: Learn about the built-in TypeScript plugin → YouTube (3 minutes)\n\nEnd-to-End Type Safety\n\nThe Next.js App Router has enhanced type safety. This includes:\n\nNo serialization of data between fetching function and page: You can fetch directly in components, layouts, and pages on the server. This data does not need to be serialized (converted to a string) to be passed to the client side for consumption in React. Instead, since app uses Server Components by default, we can use values like Date, Map, Set, and more without any extra steps. Previously, you needed to manually type the boundary between server and client with Next.js-specific types.\nStreamlined data flow between components: With the removal of _app in favor of root layouts, it is now easier to visualize the data flow between components and pages. Previously, data flowing between individual pages and _app were difficult to type and could introduce confusing bugs. With colocated data fetching in the App Router, this is no longer an issue.\n\nData Fetching in Next.js now provides as close to end-to-end type safety as possible without being prescriptive about your database or content provider selection.\n\nWe're able to type the response data as you would expect with normal TypeScript. For example:\n\napp/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nasync function getData() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...')\n  // The return value is *not* serialized\n  // You can return Date, Map, Set, etc.\n  return res.json()\n}\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  const name = await getData()\n \n  return '...'\n}\n\nFor complete end-to-end type safety, this also requires your database or content provider to support TypeScript. This could be through using an ORM\n or type-safe query builder.\n\nRoute-Aware Type Helpers\n\nNext.js generates global helpers for App Router route types. These are available without imports and are generated during next dev, next build, or via next typegen:\n\nPageProps\nLayoutProps\nRouteContext\nExamples\nType Checking Next.js Configuration Files\n\nYou can use TypeScript and import types in your Next.js configuration by using next.config.ts.\n\nnext.config.ts\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  /* config options here */\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nModule resolution in next.config.ts is currently limited to CommonJS. However, ECMAScript Modules (ESM) syntax is available when using Node.js native TypeScript resolver for Node.js v22.10.0 and higher.\n\nWhen using the next.config.js file, you can add some type checking in your IDE using JSDoc as below:\n\nnext.config.js\n// @ts-check\n \n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  /* config options here */\n}\n \nmodule.exports = nextConfig\nUsing Node.js Native TypeScript Resolver for next.config.ts\n\nNote: Available on Node.js v22.10.0+ and only when the feature is enabled. Next.js does not enable it.\n\nNext.js detects the Node.js native TypeScript resolver\n via process.features.typescript\n, added in v22.10.0. When present, next.config.ts can use native ESM, including top‑level await and dynamic import(). This mechanism inherits the capabilities and limitations of Node's resolver.\n\nIn Node.js versions v22.18.0+, process.features.typescript is enabled by default. For versions between v22.10.0 and 22.17.x, opt in with NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-transform-types:\n\nTerminal\nNODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-transform-types next <command>\nFor CommonJS Projects (Default)\n\nAlthough next.config.ts supports native ESM syntax on CommonJS projects, Node.js will still assume next.config.ts is a CommonJS file by default, resulting in Node.js reparsing the file as ESM when module syntax is detected. Therefore, we recommend using the next.config.mts file for CommonJS projects to explicitly indicate it's an ESM module:\n\nnext.config.mts\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \n// Top-level await and dynamic import are supported\nconst flags = await import('./flags.js').then((m) => m.default ?? m)\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  /* config options here */\n  typedRoutes: Boolean(flags?.typedRoutes),\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\nFor ESM Projects\n\nWhen \"type\" is set to \"module\" in package.json, your project uses ESM. Learn more about this setting in the Node.js docs\n. In this case, you can write next.config.ts directly with ESM syntax.\n\nGood to know: When using \"type\": \"module\" in your package.json, all .js and .ts files in your project are treated as ESM modules by default. You may need to rename files with CommonJS syntax to .cjs or .cts extensions if needed.\n\nStatically Typed Links\n\nNext.js can statically type links to prevent typos and other errors when using next/link, improving type safety when navigating between pages.\n\nWorks in both the Pages and App Router for the href prop in next/link. In the App Router, it also types next/navigation methods like push, replace, and prefetch. It does not type next/router methods in Pages Router.\n\nLiteral href strings are validated, while non-literal hrefs may require a cast with as Route.\n\nTo opt-into this feature, typedRoutes need to be enabled and the project needs to be using TypeScript.\n\nnext.config.ts\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  typedRoutes: true,\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nNext.js will generate a link definition in .next/types that contains information about all existing routes in your application, which TypeScript can then use to provide feedback in your editor about invalid links.\n\nGood to know: If you set up your project without create-next-app, ensure the generated Next.js types are included by adding .next/types/**/*.ts to the include array in your tsconfig.json:\n\ntsconfig.json\n{\n  \"include\": [\n    \"next-env.d.ts\",\n    \".next/types/**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.tsx\"\n  ],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n\nCurrently, support includes any string literal, including dynamic segments. For non-literal strings, you need to manually cast with as Route. The example below shows both next/link and next/navigation usage:\n\napp/example-client.tsx\n'use client'\n \nimport type { Route } from 'next'\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function Example() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const slug = 'nextjs'\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      {/* Link: literal and dynamic */}\n      <Link href=\"/about\" />\n      <Link href={`/blog/${slug}`} />\n      <Link href={('/blog/' + slug) as Route} />\n      {/* TypeScript error if href is not a valid route */}\n      <Link href=\"/aboot\" />\n \n      {/* Router: literal and dynamic strings are validated */}\n      <button onClick={() => router.push('/about')}>Push About</button>\n      <button onClick={() => router.replace(`/blog/${slug}`)}>\n        Replace Blog\n      </button>\n      <button onClick={() => router.prefetch('/contact')}>\n        Prefetch Contact\n      </button>\n \n      {/* For non-literal strings, cast to Route */}\n      <button onClick={() => router.push(('/blog/' + slug) as Route)}>\n        Push Non-literal Blog\n      </button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nThe same applies for redirecting routes defined by proxy:\n\nproxy.ts\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function proxy(request: NextRequest) {\n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname === '/proxy-redirect') {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', request.url))\n  }\n \n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\napp/some/page.tsx\nimport type { Route } from 'next'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Link href={'/proxy-redirect' as Route}>Link Text</Link>\n}\n\nTo accept href in a custom component wrapping next/link, use a generic:\n\nimport type { Route } from 'next'\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Card<T extends string>({ href }: { href: Route<T> | URL }) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={href}>\n      <div>My Card</div>\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n\nYou can also type a simple data structure and iterate to render links:\n\ncomponents/nav-items.ts\nimport type { Route } from 'next'\n \ntype NavItem<T extends string = string> = {\n  href: T\n  label: string\n}\n \nexport const navItems: NavItem<Route>[] = [\n  { href: '/', label: 'Home' },\n  { href: '/about', label: 'About' },\n  { href: '/blog', label: 'Blog' },\n]\n\nThen, map over the items to render Links:\n\ncomponents/nav.tsx\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport { navItems } from './nav-items'\n \nexport function Nav() {\n  return (\n    <nav>\n      {navItems.map((item) => (\n        <Link key={item.href} href={item.href}>\n          {item.label}\n        </Link>\n      ))}\n    </nav>\n  )\n}\n\nHow does it work?\n\nWhen running next dev or next build, Next.js generates a hidden .d.ts file inside .next that contains information about all existing routes in your application (all valid routes as the href type of Link). This .d.ts file is included in tsconfig.json and the TypeScript compiler will check that .d.ts and provide feedback in your editor about invalid links.\n\nType IntelliSense for Environment Variables\n\nDuring development, Next.js generates a .d.ts file in .next/types that contains information about the loaded environment variables for your editor's IntelliSense. If the same environment variable key is defined in multiple files, it is deduplicated according to the Environment Variable Load Order.\n\nTo opt-into this feature, experimental.typedEnv needs to be enabled and the project needs to be using TypeScript.\n\nnext.config.ts\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  experimental: {\n    typedEnv: true,\n  },\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nGood to know: Types are generated based on the environment variables loaded at development runtime, which excludes variables from .env.production* files by default. To include production-specific variables, run next dev with NODE_ENV=production.\n\nWith Async Server Components\n\nTo use an async Server Component with TypeScript, ensure you are using TypeScript 5.1.3 or higher and @types/react 18.2.8 or higher.\n\nIf you are using an older version of TypeScript, you may see a 'Promise<Element>' is not a valid JSX element type error. Updating to the latest version of TypeScript and @types/react should resolve this issue.\n\nIncremental type checking\n\nSince v10.2.1 Next.js supports incremental type checking\n when enabled in your tsconfig.json, this can help speed up type checking in larger applications.\n\nCustom tsconfig path\n\nIn some cases, you might want to use a different TypeScript configuration for builds or tooling. To do that, set typescript.tsconfigPath in next.config.ts to point Next.js to another tsconfig file.\n\nnext.config.ts\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  typescript: {\n    tsconfigPath: 'tsconfig.build.json',\n  },\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nFor example, switch to a different config for production builds:\n\nnext.config.ts\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  typescript: {\n    tsconfigPath: isProd ? 'tsconfig.build.json' : 'tsconfig.json',\n  },\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\nWhy you might use a separate tsconfig for builds\n\nGood to know:\n\nIDEs typically read tsconfig.json for diagnostics and IntelliSense, so you can still see IDE warnings while production builds use the alternate config. Mirror critical options if you want parity in the editor.\nIn development, only tsconfig.json is watched for changes. If you edit a different file name via typescript.tsconfigPath, restart the dev server to apply changes.\nThe configured file is used in next dev, next build, and next typegen.\nDisabling TypeScript errors in production\n\nNext.js fails your production build (next build) when TypeScript errors are present in your project.\n\nIf you'd like Next.js to dangerously produce production code even when your application has errors, you can disable the built-in type checking step.\n\nIf disabled, be sure you are running type checks as part of your build or deploy process, otherwise this can be very dangerous.\n\nOpen next.config.ts and enable the ignoreBuildErrors option in the typescript config:\n\nnext.config.ts\nimport type { NextConfig } from 'next'\n \nconst nextConfig: NextConfig = {\n  typescript: {\n    // !! WARN !!\n    // Dangerously allow production builds to successfully complete even if\n    // your project has type errors.\n    // !! WARN !!\n    ignoreBuildErrors: true,\n  },\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n\nGood to know: You can run tsc --noEmit to check for TypeScript errors yourself before building. This is useful for CI/CD pipelines where you'd like to check for TypeScript errors before deploying.\n\nCustom type declarations\n\nWhen you need to declare custom types, you might be tempted to modify next-env.d.ts. However, this file is automatically generated, so any changes you make will be overwritten. Instead, you should create a new file, let's call it new-types.d.ts, and reference it in your tsconfig.json:\n\ntsconfig.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true\n    //...truncated...\n  },\n  \"include\": [\n    \"new-types.d.ts\",\n    \"next-env.d.ts\",\n    \".next/types/**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.tsx\"\n  ],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\nVersion Changes\nVersion\tChanges\nv15.0.0\tnext.config.ts support added for TypeScript projects.\nv13.2.0\tStatically typed links are available in beta.\nv12.0.0\tSWC is now used by default to compile TypeScript and TSX for faster builds.\nv10.2.1\tIncremental type checking\n support added when enabled in your tsconfig.json.\nPrevious\nwebVitalsAttribution\nNext\nESLint\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

root directory (such as a monorepo), you can tell @next/eslint-plugin-next where to find your Next.js application using the settings property in your eslint.config.mjs:\n\neslint.config.mjs\nimport { defineConfig } from 'eslint/config'\nimport eslintNextPlugin from '@next/eslint-plugin-next'\n \nconst eslintConfig = defineConfig([\n  {\n    plugins: {\n      next: eslintNextPlugin,\n    },\n    settings: {\n      next: {\n        rootDir: 'packages/my-app/',\n      },\n    },\n    files: [\n      // ...files\n    ],\n    ignores: [\n      // ...ignores\n    ],\n  },\n])\n \nexport default eslintConfig\n\nrootDir can be a path (relative or absolute), a glob (i.e. \"packages/*/\"), or an array of paths and/or globs.\n\nDisabling rules\n\nIf you would like to modify or disable any rules provided by the supported plugins (react, react-hooks, next), you can directly change them using the rules property in your eslint.config.mjs:\n\neslint.config.mjs\nimport { defineConfig, globalIgnores } from 'eslint/config'\nimport nextVitals from 'eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals'\n \nconst eslintConfig = defineConfig([\n  ...nextVitals,\n  {\n    rules: {\n      'react/no-unescaped-entities': 'off',\n      '@next/next/no-page-custom-font': 'off',\n    },\n  },\n  // Override default ignores of eslint-config-next.\n  globalIgnores([\n    // Default ignores of eslint-config-next:\n    '.next/**',\n    'out/**',\n    'build/**',\n    'next-env.d.ts',\n  ]),\n])\n \nexport default eslintConfig\nWith Core Web Vitals\n\nEnable the next/core-web-vitals rule set by extending it in your ESLint config.\n\neslint.config.mjs\nimport { defineConfig, globalIgnores } from 'eslint/config'\nimport nextVitals from 'eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals'\n \nconst eslintConfig = defineConfig([\n  ...nextVitals,\n  // Override default ignores of eslint-config-next.\n  globalIgnores([\n    // Default ignores of eslint-config-next:\n    '.next/**',\n    'out/**',\n    'build/**',\n    'next-env.d.ts',\n  ]),\n])\n \nexport default eslintConfig\n\nnext/core-web-vitals updates @next/eslint-plugin-next to error on a number of rules that are warnings by default if they affect Core Web Vitals\n.\n\nThe next/core-web-vitals entry point is automatically included for new applications built with Create Next App.\n\nWith TypeScript\n\nIn addition to the Next.js ESLint rules, create-next-app --typescript will also add TypeScript-specific lint rules with next/typescript to your config:\n\neslint.config.mjs\nimport { defineConfig, globalIgnores } from 'eslint/config'\nimport nextVitals from 'eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals'\nimport nextTs from 'eslint-config-next/typescript'\n \nconst eslintConfig = defineConfig([\n  ...nextVitals,\n  ...nextTs,\n  // Override default ignores of eslint-config-next.\n  globalIgnores([\n    // Default ignores of eslint-config-next:\n    '.next/**',\n    'out/**',\n    'build/**',\n    'next-env.d.ts',\n  ]),\n])\n \nexport default eslintConfig\n\nThose rules are based on plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended\n. See typescript-eslint > Configs\n for more details.\n\nWith Prettier\n\nESLint also contains code formatting rules, which can conflict with your existing Prettier\n setup. We recommend including eslint-config-prettier\n in your ESLint config to make ESLint and Prettier work together.\n\nFirst, install the dependency:\n\npnpm\nnpm\nyarn\nbun\nTerminal\npnpm add -D eslint-config-prettier\n\nThen, add prettier to your existing ESLint config:\n\neslint.config.mjs\nimport { defineConfig, globalIgnores } from 'eslint/config'\nimport nextVitals from 'eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals'\nimport prettier from 'eslint-config-prettier/flat'\n \nconst eslintConfig = defineConfig([\n  ...nextVitals,\n  prettier,\n  // Override default ignores of eslint-config-next.\n  globalIgnores([\n    // Default ignores of eslint-config-next:\n    '.next/**',\n    'out/**',\n    'build/**',\n    'next-env.d.ts',\n  ]),\n])\n \nexport default eslintConfig\nRunning lint on staged files\n\nIf you would like to use ESLint with lint-staged\n to run the linter on staged git files, add the following to the .lintstagedrc.js file in the root of your project:\n\n.lintstagedrc.js\nconst path = require('path')\n \nconst buildEslintCommand = (filenames) =>\n  `eslint --fix ${filenames\n    .map((f) => `\"${path.relative(process.cwd(), f)}\"`)\n    .join(' ')}`\n \nmodule.exports = {\n  '*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}': [buildEslintCommand],\n}\nMigrating existing config\n\nIf you already have ESLint configured in your application, we recommend extending from this plugin directly instead of including eslint-config-next unless a few conditions are met.\n\nRecommended plugin ruleset\n\nIf the following conditions are true:\n\nYou have one or more of the following plugins already installed (either separately or through a different config such as airbnb or react-app):\nreact\nreact-hooks\njsx-a11y\nimport\nYou've defined specific parserOptions that are different from how Babel is configured within Next.js (this is not recommended unless you have customized your Babel configuration)\nYou have eslint-plugin-import installed with Node.js and/or TypeScript resolvers\n defined to handle imports\n\nThen we recommend either removing these settings if you prefer how these properties have been configured within eslint-config-next\n or extending directly from the Next.js ESLint plugin instead:\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  extends: [\n    //...\n    'plugin:@next/next/recommended',\n  ],\n}\n\nThe plugin can be installed normally in your project:\n\npnpm\nnpm\nyarn\nbun\nTerminal\npnpm add -D @next/eslint-plugin-next\n\nThis eliminates the risk of collisions or errors that can occur due to importing the same plugin or parser across multiple configurations.\n\nAdditional configurations\n\nIf you already use a separate ESLint configuration and want to include eslint-config-next, ensure that it is extended last after other configurations. For example:\n\neslint.config.mjs\nimport { defineConfig, globalIgnores } from 'eslint/config'\nimport nextPlugin from '@next/eslint-plugin-next'\n \nconst eslintConfig = defineConfig([\n  nextPlugin.configs['core-web-vitals'],\n  // List of ignore patterns.\n  globalIgnores([]),\n])\n \nexport default eslintConfig\n\nThe next configuration already handles setting default values for the parser, plugins and settings properties. There is no need to manually re-declare any of these properties unless you need a different configuration for your use case.\n\nIf you include any other shareable configurations, you will need to make sure that these properties are not overwritten or modified. Otherwise, we recommend removing any configurations that share behavior with the next configuration or extending directly from the Next.js ESLint plugin as mentioned above.\n\nVersion\tChanges\nv16.0.0\tnext lint and the eslint next.config.js option were removed in favor of the ESLint CLI.

This information includes Operating System platform/arch/version, Binaries (Node.js, npm, Yarn, pnpm), package versions (next, react, react-dom), and more.\n\nThe output should look like this:\n\nTerminal\nOperating System:\n  Platform: darwin\n  Arch: arm64\n  Version: Darwin Kernel Version 23.6.0\n  Available memory (MB): 65536\n  Available CPU cores: 10\nBinaries:\n  Node: 20.12.0\n  npm: 10.5.0\n  Yarn: 1.22.19\n  pnpm: 9.6.0\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 15.0.0-canary.115 // Latest available version is detected (15.0.0-canary.115).\n  eslint-config-next: 14.2.5\n  react: 19.0.0-rc\n  react-dom: 19.0.0\n  typescript: 5.5.4\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n\nThe following options are available for the next info command:\n\nOption\tDescription\n-h or --help\tShow all available options\n--verbose\tCollects additional information for debugging.\nnext telemetry options\n\nNext.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage. Participation in this anonymous program is optional, and you can opt-out if you prefer not to share information.\n\nThe following options are available for the next telemetry command:\n\nOption\tDescription\n-h, --help\tShow all available options.\n--enable\tEnables Next.js' telemetry collection.\n--disable\tDisables Next.js' telemetry collection.\n\nLearn more about Telemetry.\n\nnext typegen Options\n\nnext typegen generates TypeScript definitions for your application's routes without performing a full build. This is useful for IDE autocomplete and CI type-checking of route usage.\n\nPreviously, route types were only generated during next dev or next build, which meant running tsc --noEmit directly wouldn't validate your route types. Now you can generate types independently and validate them externally:\n\nTerminal\n# Generate route types first, then validate with TypeScript\nnext typegen && tsc --noEmit\n \n# Or in CI workflows for type checking without building\nnext typegen && npm run type-check\n\nThe following options are available for the next typegen command:\n\nOption\tDescription\n-h, --help\tShow all available options.\n[directory]\tA directory on which to generate types. If not provided, the current directory will be used.\n\nOutput files are written to <distDir>/types (typically: .next/dev/types or .next/types, see isolatedDevBuild):\n\nTerminal\nnext typegen\n# or for a specific app\nnext typegen ./apps/web\n\nAdditionally, next typegen generates a next-env.d.ts file. We recommend adding next-env.d.ts to your .gitignore file.\n\nThe next-env.d.ts file is included into your tsconfig.json file, to make Next.js types available to your project.\n\nTo ensure next-env.d.ts is present before type-checking run next typegen. The commands next dev and next build also generate the next-env.d.ts file, but it is often undesirable to run these just to type-check, for example in CI/CD environments.\n\nGood to know: next typegen loads your Next.js config (next.config.js, next.config.mjs, or next.config.ts) using the production build phase. Ensure any required environment variables and dependencies are available so the config can load correctly.\n\nExamples\nDebugging prerender errors\n\nIf you encounter prerendering errors during next build, you can pass the --debug-prerender flag to get more detailed output:\n\nTerminal\nnext build --debug-prerender\n\nThis enables several experimental options to make debugging easier:\n\nDisables server code minification:\nexperimental.serverMinification = false\nexperimental.turbopackMinify = false\nGenerates source maps for server bundles:\nexperimental.serverSourceMaps = true\nEnables source map consumption in child processes used for prerendering:\nenablePrerenderSourceMaps = true\nContinues building even after the first prerender error, so you can see all issues at once:\nexperimental.prerenderEarlyExit = false\n\nThis helps surface more readable stack traces and code frames in the build output.\n\nWarning: --debug-prerender is for debugging in development only. Do not deploy builds generated with --debug-prerender to production, as it may impact performance.\n\nBuilding specific routes\n\nYou can build only specific routes in the App and Pages Routers using the --debug-build-paths option. This is useful for faster debugging when working with large applications. The --debug-build-paths option accepts comma-separated file paths and supports glob patterns:\n\nTerminal\n# Build a specific route\nnext build --debug-build-paths=\"app/page.tsx\"\n \n# Build more than one route\nnext build --debug-build-paths=\"app/page.tsx,pages/index.tsx\"\n \n# Use glob patterns\nnext build --debug-build-paths=\"app/**/page.tsx\"\nnext build --debug-build-paths=\"pages/*.tsx\"\nChanging the default port\n\nBy default, Next.js uses http://localhost:3000 during development and with next start. The default port can be changed with the -p option, like so:\n\nTerminal\nnext dev -p 4000\n\nOr using the PORT environment variable:\n\nTerminal\nPORT=4000 next dev\n\nGood to know: PORT cannot be set in .env as booting up the HTTP server happens before any other code is initialized.\n\nUsing HTTPS during development\n\nFor certain use cases like webhooks or authentication, you can use HTTPS\n to have a secure environment on localhost. Next.js can generate a self-signed certificate with next dev using the --experimental-https flag:\n\nTerminal\nnext dev --experimental-https\n\nWith the generated certificate, the Next.js development server will exist at https://localhost:3000. The default port 3000 is used unless a port is specified with -p, --port, or PORT.\n\nYou can also provide a custom certificate and key with --experimental-https-key and --experimental-https-cert. Optionally, you can provide a custom CA certificate with --experimental-https-ca as well.\n\nTerminal\nnext dev --experimental-https --experimental-https-key ./certificates/localhost-key.pem --experimental-https-cert ./certificates/localhost.pem\n\nnext dev --experimental-https is only intended for development and creates a locally trusted certificate with mkcert\n. In production, use properly issued certificates from trusted authorities.\n\nConfiguring a timeout for downstream proxies\n\nWhen deploying Next.js behind a downstream proxy (e.g. a load-balancer like AWS ELB/ALB), it's important to configure Next's underlying HTTP server with keep-alive timeouts\n that are larger than the downstream proxy's timeouts. Otherwise, once a keep-alive timeout is reached for a given TCP connection, Node.js will immediately terminate that connection without notifying the downstream proxy. This results in a proxy error whenever it attempts to reuse a connection that Node.js has already terminated.\n\nTo configure the timeout values for the production Next.js server, pass --keepAliveTimeout (in milliseconds) to next start, like so:\n\nTerminal\nnext start --keepAliveTimeout 70000\nPassing Node.js arguments\n\nYou can pass any node arguments\n to next commands. For example:\n\nTerminal\nNODE_OPTIONS='--throw-deprecation' next\nNODE_OPTIONS='-r esm' next\nNODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next\nVersion\tChanges\nv16.0.0\tThe JS bundle size metrics have been removed from next build\nv15.5.0\tAdd the next typegen command\nv15.4.0\tAdd --debug-prerender option for next build to help debug prerender errors.\nPrevious\ncreate-next-app\nNext\nEdge Runtime\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

    "html": "App Router\nAPI Reference\nTurbopack\nCopy page\nTurbopack\n\nTurbopack is an incremental bundler optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust, and built into Next.js. You can use Turbopack with both the Pages and App Router for a much faster local development experience.\n\nWhy Turbopack?\n\nWe built Turbopack to push the performance of Next.js, including:\n\nUnified Graph: Next.js supports multiple output environments (e.g., client and server). Managing multiple compilers and stitching bundles together can be tedious. Turbopack uses a single, unified graph for all environments.\nBundling vs Native ESM: Some tools skip bundling in development and rely on the browser's native ESM. This works well for small apps but can slow down large apps due to excessive network requests. Turbopack bundles in dev, but in an optimized way to keep large apps fast.\nIncremental Computation: Turbopack parallelizes work across cores and caches results down to the function level. Once a piece of work is done, Turbopack won’t repeat it.\nLazy Bundling: Turbopack only bundles what is actually requested by the dev server. This lazy approach can reduce initial compile times and memory usage.\nGetting started\n\nTurbopack is now the default bundler in Next.js. No configuration is needed to use Turbopack:\n\npackage.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\nUsing Webpack instead\n\nIf you need to use Webpack instead of Turbopack, you can opt-in with the --webpack flag:\n\npackage.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev --webpack\",\n    \"build\": \"next build --webpack\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\nSupported features\n\nTurbopack in Next.js has zero-configuration for the common use cases. Below is a summary of what is supported out of the box, plus some references to how you can configure Turbopack further when needed.\n\nLanguage features\nFeature\tStatus\tNotes\nJavaScript & TypeScript\tSupported\tUses SWC under the hood. Type-checking is not done by Turbopack (run tsc --watch or rely on your IDE for type checks).\nECMAScript (ESNext)\tSupported\tTurbopack supports the latest ECMAScript features, matching SWC’s coverage.\nCommonJS\tSupported\trequire() syntax is handled out of the box.\nESM\tSupported\tStatic and dynamic import are fully supported.\nBabel\tSupported\tStarting in Next.js 16, Turbopack uses Babel automatically if it detects a configuration file\n. Unlike in webpack, SWC is always used for Next.js's internal transforms and downleveling to older ECMAScript revisions. Next.js with webpack disables SWC if a Babel configuration file is present. Files in node_modules are excluded, unless you manually configure babel-loader.\nFramework and React features\nFeature\tStatus\tNotes\nJSX / TSX\tSupported\tSWC handles JSX/TSX compilation.\nFast Refresh\tSupported\tNo configuration needed.\nReact Server Components (RSC)\tSupported\tFor the Next.js App Router. Turbopack ensures correct server/client bundling.\nRoot layout creation\tUnsupported\tAutomatic creation of a root layout in App Router is not supported. Turbopack will instruct you to create it manually.\nCSS and styling\nFeature\tStatus\tNotes\nGlobal CSS\tSupported\tImport .css files directly in your application.\nCSS Modules\tSupported\t.module.css files work natively (Lightning CSS).\nCSS Nesting\tSupported\tLightning CSS supports modern CSS nesting\n.\n@import syntax\tSupported\tCombine multiple CSS files.\nPostCSS\tSupported\tAutomatically processes postcss.config.js in a Node.js worker pool. Useful for Tailwind, Autoprefixer, etc.\nSass / SCSS\tSupported (Next.js)\tFor Next.js, Sass is supported out of the box. Custom Sass functions (sassOptions.functions) are not supported because Turbopack's Rust-based architecture cannot directly execute JavaScript functions, unlike webpack's Node.js environment. Use webpack if you need this feature. In the future, Turbopack standalone usage will likely require a loader config.\nLess\tPlanned via plugins\tNot yet supported by default. Will likely require a loader config once custom loaders are stable.\nLightning CSS\tIn Use\tHandles CSS transformations. Some low-usage CSS Modules features (like :local/:global as standalone pseudo-classes) are not yet supported. See below for more details.\nAssets\nFeature\tStatus\tNotes\nStatic Assets (images, fonts)\tSupported\tImporting import img from './img.png' works out of the box. In Next.js, returns an object for the <Image /> component.\nJSON Imports\tSupported\tNamed or default imports from .json are supported.\nModule resolution\nFeature\tStatus\tNotes\nPath Aliases\tSupported\tReads tsconfig.json's paths and baseUrl, matching Next.js behavior.\nManual Aliases\tSupported\tConfigure resolveAlias in next.config.js (similar to webpack.resolve.alias).\nCustom Extensions\tSupported\tConfigure resolveExtensions in next.config.js.\nAMD\tPartially Supported\tBasic transforms work; advanced AMD usage is limited.\nPerformance and Fast Refresh\nFeature\tStatus\tNotes\nFast Refresh\tSupported\tUpdates JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS without a full refresh.\nIncremental Bundling\tSupported\tTurbopack lazily builds only what’s requested by the dev server, speeding up large apps.\nKnown gaps with webpack\n\nThere are a number of non-trivial behavior differences between webpack and Turbopack that are important to be aware of when migrating an application. Generally, these are less of a concern for new applications.\n\nCSS Module Ordering\n\nTurbopack will follow JS import order to order CSS modules which are not otherwise ordered. For example:\n\ncomponents/BlogPost.jsx\nimport utilStyles from './utils.module.css'\nimport buttonStyles from './button.module.css'\nexport default function BlogPost() {\n  return (\n    <div className={utilStyles.container}>\n      <button className={buttonStyles.primary}>Click me</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nIn this example, Turbopack will ensure that utils.module.css will appear before button.module.css in the produced CSS chunk, following the import order\n\nWebpack generally does this as well, but there are cases where it will ignore JS inferred ordering, for example if it infers the JS file is side-effect-free.\n\nThis can lead to subtle rendering changes when adopting Turbopack, if applications have come to rely on an arbitrary ordering. Generally, the solution is easy, e.g. have button.module.css @import utils.module.css to force the ordering, or identify the conflicting rules and change them to not target the same properties.\n\nSass node_modules imports\n\nTurbopack supports importing node_modules Sass files out of the box. Webpack supports a legacy tilde ~ syntax for this, which is not supported by Turbopack.\n\nFrom:\n\nstyles/globals.scss\n@import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\n\nTo:\n\nstyles/globals.scss\n@import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\n\nIf you can't update the imports, you can add a turbopack.resolveAlias configuration to map the ~ syntax to the actual path:\n\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  turbopack: {\n    resolveAlias: {\n      '~*': '*',\n    },\n  },\n}\nBundle Sizes\n\nFrom our testing on production applications, we observed that Turbopack generally produces bundles that are similar in size to Webpack. However, the comparison can be difficult since turbopack tends to produce fewer but larger chunks. Our advice is to focus on higher level metrics like Core Web Vitals\n or your own application level metrics to compare performance across the two bundlers. We are however aware of one gap that can occasionally cause a large regression.\n\nTurbopack does not yet have an equivalent to the Inner Graph Optimization\n in webpack which is enabled by default. This optimization is useful to tree shake large modules. For example:\n\nimport heavy from 'some-heavy-dependency.js'\n \nexport function usesHeavy() {\n  return heavy.run()\n}\n \nexport const CONSTANT_VALUE = 3\n\nIf an application only uses CONSTANT_VALUE Turbopack will detect this and delete the usesHeavy export but not the corresponding import. However, with the Inner Graph Optimization, webpack can delete the import too which can drop the dependency as well.\n\nWe are planning to offer an equivalent to the Inner Graph Optimization in Turbopack but it is still under development. If you are affected by this gap, consider manually splitting modules.\n\nBuild Caching\n\nWebpack supports disk build caching\n to improve build performance. Turbopack provides a similar opt-in feature, currently in beta. Starting with Next 16, you can enable Turbopack’s filesystem cache by setting the following experimental flags:\n\nexperimental.turbopackFileSystemCacheForDev\nexperimental.turbopackFileSystemCacheForBuild\n\nGood to know: For this reason, when comparing webpack and Turbopack performance, make sure to delete the .next folder between builds to see a fair comparison or enable the turbopack filesystem cache feature.\n\nWebpack plugins\n\nTurbopack does not support webpack plugins. This affects third-party tools that rely on webpack's plugin system for integration. We do support webpack loaders. If you depend on webpack plugins, you'll need to find Turbopack-compatible alternatives or continue using webpack until equivalent functionality is available.\n\nUnsupported and unplanned features\n\nSome features are not yet implemented or not planned:\n\nLegacy CSS Modules features\nStandalone :local and :global pseudo-classes (only the function variant :global(...) is supported).\nThe @value rule (superseded by CSS variables).\n:import and :export ICSS rules.\ncomposes in .module.css composing a .css file. In webpack this would treat the .css file as a CSS Module, with Turbopack the .css file will always be global. This means that if you want to use composes in a CSS Module, you need to change the .css file to a .module.css file.\n@import in CSS Modules importing .css as a CSS Module. In webpack this would treat the .css file as a CSS Module, with Turbopack the .css file will always be global. This means that if you want to use @import in a CSS Module, you need to change the .css file to a .module.css file.\nsassOptions.functions Custom Sass functions defined in sassOptions.functions are not supported. This feature allows defining JavaScript functions that can be called from Sass code during compilation. Turbopack's Rust-based architecture cannot directly execute JavaScript functions passed through sassOptions.functions, unlike webpack's Node.js-based sass-loader which runs entirely in JavaScript. If you're using custom Sass functions, you'll need to use webpack instead of Turbopack.\nwebpack() configuration in next.config.js Turbopack replaces webpack, so webpack() configs are not recognized. Use the turbopack config instead.\nYarn PnP Not planned for Turbopack support in Next.js.\nexperimental.urlImports Not planned for Turbopack.\nexperimental.esmExternals Not planned. Turbopack does not support the legacy esmExternals configuration in Next.js.\nSome Next.js Experimental Flags\nexperimental.nextScriptWorkers\nexperimental.sri.algorithm\nexperimental.fallbackNodePolyfills We plan to implement these in the future.\n\nFor a full, detailed breakdown of each feature flag and its status, see the Turbopack API Reference.\n\nConfiguration\n\nTurbopack can be configured via next.config.js (or next.config.ts) under the turbopack key. Configuration options include:\n\nrules Define additional webpack loaders for file transformations.\nresolveAlias Create manual aliases (like resolve.alias in webpack).\nresolveExtensions Change or extend file extensions for module resolution.\nnext.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  turbopack: {\n    // Example: adding an alias and custom file extension\n    resolveAlias: {\n      underscore: 'lodash',\n    },\n    resolveExtensions: ['.mdx', '.tsx', '.ts', '.jsx', '.js', '.json'],\n  },\n}\n\nFor more in-depth configuration examples, see the Turbopack config documentation.\n\nGenerating trace files for performance debugging\n\nIf you encounter performance or memory issues and want to help the Next.js team diagnose them, you can generate a trace file by appending NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1 to your dev command:\n\nNEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1 next dev\n\nThis will produce a .next/dev/trace-turbopack file. Include that file when creating a GitHub issue on the Next.js repo\n to help us investigate.\n\nBy default the development server outputs to .next/dev. Read more about isolatedDevBuild.\n\nSummary\n\nTurbopack is a Rust-based, incremental bundler designed to make local development and builds fast—especially for large applications. It is integrated into Next.js, offering zero-config CSS, React, and TypeScript support.\n\nVersion Changes\nVersion\tChanges\nv16.0.0\tTurbopack becomes the default bundler for Next.js.

    "html": "App Router\nGetting Started\nMetadata and OG images\nCopy page\nMetadata and OG images\n\nThe Metadata APIs can be used to define your application metadata for improved SEO and web shareability and include:\n\nThe static metadata object\nThe dynamic generateMetadata function\nSpecial file conventions that can be used to add static or dynamically generated favicons and OG images.\n\nWith all the options above, Next.js will automatically generate the relevant <head> tags for your page, which can be inspected in the browser's developer tools.\n\nThe metadata object and generateMetadata function exports are only supported in Server Components.\n\nDefault fields\n\nThere are two default meta tags that are always added even if a route doesn't define metadata:\n\nThe meta charset tag\n sets the character encoding for the website.\nThe meta viewport tag\n sets the viewport width and scale for the website to adjust for different devices.\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\nThe other metadata fields can be defined with the Metadata object (for static metadata) or the generateMetadata function (for generated metadata).\n\nStatic metadata\n\nTo define static metadata, export a Metadata object from a static layout.js or page.js file. For example, to add a title and description to the blog route:\n\napp/blog/layout.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'My Blog',\n  description: '...',\n}\n \nexport default function Layout() {}\n\nYou can view a full list of available options, in the generateMetadata documentation.\n\nGenerated metadata\n\nYou can use generateMetadata function to fetch metadata that depends on data. For example, to fetch the title and description for a specific blog post:\n\napp/blog/[slug]/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport type { Metadata, ResolvingMetadata } from 'next'\n \ntype Props = {\n  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>\n  searchParams: Promise<{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }>\n}\n \nexport async function generateMetadata(\n  { params, searchParams }: Props,\n  parent: ResolvingMetadata\n): Promise<Metadata> {\n  const slug = (await params).slug\n \n  // fetch post information\n  const post = await fetch(`https://api.vercel.app/blog/${slug}`).then((res) =>\n    res.json()\n  )\n \n  return {\n    title: post.title,\n    description: post.description,\n  }\n}\n \nexport default function Page({ params, searchParams }: Props) {}\nStreaming metadata\n\nFor dynamically rendered pages, Next.js streams metadata separately, injecting it into the HTML once generateMetadata resolves, without blocking UI rendering.\n\nStreaming metadata improves perceived performance by allowing visual content to stream first.\n\nStreaming metadata is disabled for bots and crawlers that expect metadata to be in the <head> tag (e.g. Twitterbot, Slackbot, Bingbot). These are detected by using the User Agent header from the incoming request.\n\nYou can customize or disable streaming metadata completely, with the htmlLimitedBots option in your Next.js config file.\n\nStatically rendered pages don’t use streaming since metadata is resolved at build time.\n\nLearn more about streaming metadata.\n\nMemoizing data requests\n\nThere may be cases where you need to fetch the same data for metadata and the page itself. To avoid duplicate requests, you can use React's cache function\n to memoize the return value and only fetch the data once. For example, to fetch the blog post information for both the metadata and the page:\n\napp/lib/data.ts\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { cache } from 'react'\nimport { db } from '@/app/lib/db'\n \n// getPost will be used twice, but execute only once\nexport const getPost = cache(async (slug: string) => {\n  const res = await db.query.posts.findFirst({ where: eq(posts.slug, slug) })\n  return res\n})\napp/blog/[slug]/page.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { getPost } from '@/app/lib/data'\n \nexport async function generateMetadata({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: { slug: string }\n}) {\n  const post = await getPost(params.slug)\n  return {\n    title: post.title,\n    description: post.description,\n  }\n}\n \nexport default async function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params.slug)\n  return <div>{post.title}</div>\n}\nFile-based metadata\n\nThe following special files are available for metadata:\n\nfavicon.ico, apple-icon.jpg, and icon.jpg\nopengraph-image.jpg and twitter-image.jpg\nrobots.txt\nsitemap.xml\n\nYou can use these for static metadata, or you can programmatically generate these files with code.\n\nFavicons\n\nFavicons are small icons that represent your site in bookmarks and search results. To add a favicon to your application, create a favicon.ico and add to the root of the app folder.\n\nYou can also programmatically generate favicons using code. See the favicon docs for more information.\n\nStatic Open Graph images\n\nOpen Graph (OG) images are images that represent your site in social media. To add a static OG image to your application, create a opengraph-image.png file in the root of the app folder.\n\nYou can also add OG images for specific routes by creating a opengraph-image.png deeper down the folder structure. For example, to create an OG image specific to the /blog route, add a opengraph-image.jpg file inside the blog folder.\n\nThe more specific image will take precedence over any OG images above it in the folder structure.\n\nOther image formats such as jpeg, png, and gif are also supported. See the Open Graph Image docs for more information.\n\nGenerated Open Graph images\n\nThe ImageResponse constructor allows you to generate dynamic images using JSX and CSS. This is useful for OG images that depend on data.\n\nFor example, to generate a unique OG image for each blog post, add a opengraph-image.tsx file inside the blog folder, and import the ImageResponse constructor from next/og:\n\napp/blog/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nTypeScript\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'\nimport { getPost } from '@/app/lib/data'\n \n// Image metadata\nexport const size = {\n  width: 1200,\n  height: 630,\n}\n \nexport const contentType = 'image/png'\n \n// Image generation\nexport default async function Image({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params.slug)\n \n  return new ImageResponse(\n    (\n      // ImageResponse JSX element\n      <div\n        style={{\n          fontSize: 128,\n          background: 'white',\n          width: '100%',\n          height: '100%',\n          display: 'flex',\n          alignItems: 'center',\n          justifyContent: 'center',\n        }}\n      >\n        {post.title}\n      </div>\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nImageResponse supports common CSS properties including flexbox and absolute positioning, custom fonts, text wrapping, centering, and nested images. See the full list of supported CSS properties.\n\nGood to know:\n\nExamples are available in the Vercel OG Playground\n.\nImageResponse uses @vercel/og\n, satori\n, and resvg to convert HTML and CSS into PNG.\nOnly flexbox and a subset of CSS properties are supported. Advanced layouts (e.g. display: grid) will not work.\nAPI Reference\nLearn more about the Metadata APIs mentioned in this page.\ngenerateMetadata\nLearn how to add Metadata to your Next.js application for improved search engine optimization (SEO) and web shareability.\ngenerateViewport\nAPI Reference for the generateViewport function.\nImageResponse\nAPI Reference for the ImageResponse constructor.\nMetadata Files\nAPI documentation for the metadata file conventions.\nfavicon, icon, and apple-icon\nAPI Reference for the Favicon, Icon and Apple Icon file conventions.\nopengraph-image and twitter-image\nAPI Reference for the Open Graph Image and Twitter Image file conventions.\nrobots.txt\nAPI Reference for robots.txt file.\nsitemap.xml\nAPI Reference for the sitemap.xml file.\nhtmlLimitedBots\nSpecify a list of user agents that should receive blocking metadata.\nPrevious\nFont Optimization\nNext\nRoute Handlers\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nsupported.\nSend"

Each product has a single pricing model, but you can create multiple products with different pricing models, and showcase them both at checkout.\n​\nTrial Period\nFor recurring products, you can set a trial period during which the customer won’t be charged. Toggle Enable trial period to enable it. Then, you’ll be able to set the duration of the trial period, given a number and a unit (days, weeks, months or years).\nYou can read more about how trials work here.\n​\nProduct Media\nYou can upload public product images to be displayed on product pages\nThey can be up to 10MB each\nYou can remove and re-arrange images\n​\nCheckout Fields\nYou can collect additional information from your customers at checkout.

With Polar, you can easily set up free trials for your subscription products.\n​\nSetting up a trial\nYou can set up a trial period through the following means:\nWhen creating or editing a product.\nWhen creating or editing a checkout link.\nWhen creating a Checkout Session through the API.\nIf you set a trial period on the Checkout Link or Checkout Session, it will override the trial period set on the product.\nThe trial period consists of two parameters:\nA unit: day, week, month, or year.\nA duration: a number representing how many units the trial will last.\n​\nStarting a trial\nWhen a customer checks out a subscription product with a trial period, they will not be charged immediately. Instead, they will have access to the product for the duration of the trial period.\nWe’ll still collect their payment information at checkout, but they won’t be charged until the trial period ends. This means that if they decide to cancel before the trial ends, they won’t be charged at all.\nOnce the trial period ends, the customer will be automatically charged for the subscription, and their billing cycle will begin.\n​\nAdding, extending or canceling a trial\nFor existing subscriptions, youu can add, extend or cancel a customer’s trial period at any time through the dashboard, from the subscription details page. Click on Update Subscription, then click on the Trial tab.\nTo add or extend a trial, set a new trial end date in the future. If the subscription was active, its status will be changed to trialing, and the billing will be postponed until the end of the trial.\nTo cancel a trial, click on the End trial button. The subscription will become active immediately, and the customer will be charged immediately for a new billing cycle.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nPrevious\nSeat-Based Pricing\nSell team products with assignable seats and tiered pricing\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

    "url": "https://polar.sh/docs/features/seat-based-pricing",
    "html": "Features\nSeat-Based Pricing\nCopy page\n\nSell team products with assignable seats and tiered pricing\n\nSeat-based pricing allows you to sell products where a billing manager purchases a specific number of seats and can assign them to team members. Each seat holder gets their own access to the product benefits, making it perfect for team subscriptions, perpetual licenses, and multi-user products.\nSeat-based pricing is ideal for:\nTeam subscriptions where one billing manager pays for multiple users\nPerpetual team licenses with one-time payment\nOrganizational licenses with per-seat pricing\nProducts with volume-based tiering (e.g., $10/seat for 1-4 seats, $9/seat for 5+)\n​\nFeature Flag\nSeat-based pricing is controlled by a feature flag at the organization level. You can enable this feature on the organization settings page.\n​\nHow it works\nWith seat-based pricing, a billing manager purchases a product (subscription or one-time) with a specific number of seats. They can then:\nAssign seats to team members via email or external customer ID\nManage seats by resending invitations or revoking access\nScale up by purchasing additional seats (or a new order for one-time products)\nTrack usage by viewing which seats are claimed, pending, or available\nTeam members receive an invitation email with a claim link. Once they claim their seat, benefits are automatically granted.\n​\nSubscriptions vs One-Time Purchases\nSeat-based pricing works for both recurring subscriptions and one-time purchases:\nFeature\tSubscriptions\tOne-Time Purchases\nPayment\tRecurring (monthly/yearly)\tSingle payment\nSeat Duration\tActive while subscribed\tPerpetual (never expire)\nAdding Seats\tModify subscription\tPurchase new order\nBilling\tRenews automatically\tNo renewals\nBenefits\tWhile subscription active\tForever after claim\nUse subscriptions for ongoing team access. Use one-time purchases for perpetual team licenses.\n​\nCreating a seat-based product\n1\n\nCreate a new product\n\nFrom your dashboard, navigate to Products and click Create Product.\n2\n\nConfigure basic settings\n\nSet your product name, description, and media as usual.\n3\n\nSelect seat-based pricing\n\nUnder Pricing, select:\nProduct type: Subscription or One-time\nBilling cycle (subscriptions only): Monthly or Yearly\nPricing type: Seat-based\n4\n\nConfigure seat tiers\n\nDefine your pricing tiers based on seat quantity:\nMin seats: Minimum number of seats required to purchase\nTiers: For each tier, set:\nMax seats: Upper limit for this tier (leave empty for unlimited)\nPrice per seat: Amount charged per seat in this tier (in cents)\nExample tiered pricing:\n1-4 seats: $10/seat per month\n5-9 seats: $9/seat per month\n10+ seats: $8/seat per month\n5\n\nAdd benefits\n\nConfigure the benefits that seat holders will receive. These are only granted when a seat is claimed, not when purchased.\nUnlike standard subscriptions, seat-based products do not grant benefits to the billing manager. Benefits are only granted to team members who claim their assigned seats.\n​\nPurchasing seats\nWhen a customer purchases a seat-based product, they specify how many seats they want during checkout. The total amount is calculated based on your tiered pricing.\nThe checkout experience clearly shows:\nNumber of seats being purchased\nPrice per seat based on volume\nTotal amount\nFor subscriptions: recurring billing cycle\nFor one-time: perpetual access indication\nOnce payment is completed, the billing manager can immediately start assigning seats to their team.\nFor one-time purchases, each order is independent. If customers want more seats later, they purchase a new order with its own seat pool. All purchased seats remain perpetual.\n​\nManaging seats\n​\nAssigning seats\nBilling managers can assign seats through:\nCustomer Portal: Accessible via the customer portal with billing manager permissions\nAPI: Programmatically assign seats using the Customer Seats API\nTo assign a seat, provide:\nSubscription ID (for subscriptions) or Order ID (for one-time purchases)\nEmail address (creates a new customer if needed)\nExternal customer ID (optional, for syncing with your system)\nCustomer ID (if customer already exists in Polar)\nMetadata (optional, up to 10 keys for custom data like role, department)\nAn invitation email is automatically sent to the recipient with a secure claim link (valid for 24 hours).\n​\nSeat statuses\nEach seat can have one of three statuses:\nPending: Seat assigned, invitation sent, awaiting claim\nClaimed: Seat claimed by team member, benefits granted\nRevoked: Seat revoked, benefits removed, can be reassigned\n​\nResending invitations\nFor pending seats, billing managers can resend the invitation email if it was lost or expired.\n​\nRevoking seats\nBilling managers can revoke a claimed seat at any time:\nBenefits are immediately removed from the seat holder\nThe seat becomes available for reassignment\nThe seat holder loses access to all product benefits\nThe revoked seat can be assigned to a different team member\nRevoking a seat does not issue a refund. The billing manager continues to pay for the total number of seats in their subscription.\n​\nClaiming seats\nWhen a team member receives a seat invitation:\nThey click the claim link in the email\nA claim page displays the product details and organization info\nThey click Claim Seat to accept\nBenefits are automatically granted\nThey receive a customer session token for immediate portal access\nThey can access their benefits through the customer portal\nClaim links are single-use and expire after 24 hours for security. If expired, the billing manager can resend the invitation.\n​\nScaling seats\n​\nAdding seats\nFor subscriptions:\nBilling managers can upgrade their subscription to add more seats:\nThe new seat count is applied immediately\nProrated charges are calculated for the current billing period\nFuture renewals bill at the new seat count\nNew seats can be assigned right away\nIf adding seats moves to a different pricing tier, the new per-seat rate applies to all seats, not just the additional ones.\nFor one-time purchases:\nBilling managers purchase a new order with additional seats:\nCreate a new checkout for the same product with desired seat quantity\nOnce paid, a new independent order is created\nEach order has its own seat pool\nAll seats remain perpetual across all orders\n​\nReducing seats\nFor subscriptions:\nTo reduce seats, the billing manager should:\nRevoke seats until the desired count is reached\nUpdate the subscription to reflect the lower seat count\nThe change takes effect at the next renewal\nYou cannot reduce subscription seats below the number of currently claimed seats. Revoke seats first before reducing the subscription seat count.\nFor one-time purchases:\nSeats cannot be reduced or refunded as they are perpetual. The billing manager can:\nRevoke unwanted seats to make them unassigned\nThe seats remain available for future assignment\nNo refund is issued for revoked seats\n​\nAPI Integration\nSeat-based pricing provides full API support for:\nCreating seat-based products with tiered pricing\nChecking out with seat quantities\nAssigning seats programmatically\nListing seats and their statuses\nRevoking seats\nSDK Version Requirement\nTo use seat-based pricing features, ensure you have the latest version of the Polar SDK installed:\nTypeScript/JavaScript: npm install @polar-sh/sdk@latest\nPython: pip install --upgrade polar-sdk\nOlder SDK versions may not include seat-based pricing support.\nSee the Customer Seats API Reference for complete documentation.\n​\nExample: Assign a seat (subscription)\nCopy\nAsk AI\nawait polar.customerSeats.assign({\n  subscription_id: \"sub_123\",\n  email: \"engineer@company.com\",\n  metadata: {\n    department: \"Engineering\",\n    role: \"Developer\"\n  }\n});\n\n​\nExample: Assign a seat (one-time purchase)\nCopy\nAsk AI\nawait polar.customerSeats.assign({\n  order_id: \"order_456\",\n  email: \"engineer@company.com\",\n  metadata: {\n    department: \"Engineering\",\n    role: \"Developer\"\n  }\n});\n\n​\nExample: List seats for subscription\nCopy\nAsk AI\nconst seats = await polar.customerSeats.list({\n  subscription_id: \"sub_123\"\n});\n\nconsole.log(`Available: ${seats.available_seats}/${seats.total_seats}`);\n\n​\nExample: List seats for order\nCopy\nAsk AI\nconst seats = await polar.customerSeats.list({\n  order_id: \"order_456\"\n});\n\nconsole.log(`Available: ${seats.available_seats}/${seats.total_seats}`);\n\n​\nWebhooks\nSeat-based pricing triggers webhooks for both subscriptions and orders:\nSubscription events:\nsubscription.created - When seat-based subscription is purchased\nsubscription.updated - When seat count changes\nsubscription.canceled - When subscription is cancelled\nOrder events:\norder.created - When seat-based one-time purchase is completed\norder.updated - When order is updated\nSeat and benefit events (both types):\nbenefit_grant.created - When a seat is claimed and benefits granted\nbenefit_grant.revoked - When a seat is revoked and benefits removed\nFor both subscriptions and one-time purchases, benefit_grant.created events are triggered per seat claim, not at purchase time.\n​\nBest Practices\n​\nUse tiered pricing strategically\nStructure your tiers to incentivize volume:\nLower per-seat prices as quantity increases\nCreate tiers at natural team sizes (5, 10, 25, etc.)\nConsider flat pricing for very large teams\n​\nLeverage metadata\nUse seat metadata to store:\nTeam member roles\nDepartments or cost centers\n​\nMonitor seat utilization\nTrack how many purchased seats are actually claimed to identify:\nOrganizations that may need more seats\nUnused capacity that could be reduced\nPatterns in team adoption\n​\nCommunicate clearly\nEnsure product pages clearly explain:\nThe billing manager will not get direct access\nSeats must be assigned to team members\nPricing structure and volume discounts\nSeat assignment and claiming process\n​\nLimitations\nSeats must be assigned individually (no bulk import via dashboard, use API instead)\nClaim links expire after 24 hours\nBilling manager does not receive product benefits\nMaximum of 1,000 seats per subscription\nMetadata limited to 10 keys and 1KB total size per seat\nUsage-based pricing with shared emails: If you sell to multiple businesses and different businesses assign seats to the same email address (e.g., “john@gmail.com”), and usage-based pricing is enabled, separate meters should be created for each business to properly segregate usage. This is a rare scenario since employees from different businesses typically don’t share the same email address.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nPrevious\nCustom Fields\nLearn how to add custom input fields to your checkout with Polar\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

A few examples:\nA checkbox asking the customer to accept your terms\nAn opt-in newsletter consent\nA select menu to ask where they heard from you\n…\nWith Polar, you can easily add such fields to your checkout using Custom Fields.\n​\nCreate Custom Fields\nCustom Fields are managed at an organization’s level. To create them, go to Settings and Custom Fields. You’ll see the list of all the available fields on your organization.\nClick on New Custom Field to create a new one.\n​\nType\nThe type of the field is the most important thing to select. It determines what type of input will be displayed to the customer during checkout.\nThe type can’t be changed after the field is created.\nWe support five types of fields:\n​\nText\nThis will display a simple text field to input textual data.

Each option is a pair of Value and Label, the first one being the value that’ll be stored underneath and the latter the one that will be shown to the customer.\n​\nSlug and name\nThe slug determines the key that’ll be used to store the data inside objects related to the checkout, like Orders and Subscriptions. It must be unique across your organization. You can change it afterwards, we’ll automatically update the data to reflect the new slug.\nThe name is what we’ll be displayed to you to recognize the field across your dashboard. By default, it’ll also be the label of the field displayed to the customer, unless you customize it under Form input options.\n​\nForm input options\nThose options allow you to customize how the field is displayed to the customer. You can set:\nThe label, displayed above the field\nThe help text, displayed below the field\nThe placeholder, displayed inside the field when there is no value\nThe label and help text supports basic Markdown syntax, so you can add bold, italic or even links.\n​\nAdd Custom Field to Checkout\nCustom Fields are enabled on Checkout specifically on each product. While creating or updating a product, you can select the custom fields you want to include in the checkout for this product.\nNote that you can make the field Required.\nIf you make a checkbox field required, customers will have to check the box before submitting the checkout. Very useful for terms acceptance!\nThe fields are now added as part of the Checkout form for this product.\n​\nRead data\nOnce you have added Custom Fields to your organization, they’ll be automatically displayed as a column in your Sales page, both on Orders and Subscriptions. From there, you’ll be able to see the data input by the customer.\nThis data is also available from the Orders and Subscriptions API, under the custom_field_data property.

It cannot perform privileged org-level mutations like creating products or issuing refunds.\n​\nQuick Examples\ncurl (Production - Core API)\ncurl (Sandbox - Core API)\ncurl (Customer Portal API)\nCopy\nAsk AI\ncurl https://api.polar.sh/v1/products/ \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $POLAR_OAT\" \\\n  -H \"Accept: application/json\"\n\n​\nUsing SDKs\nAll official SDKs accept a server parameter for sandbox usage:\nTypeScript\nPython\nGo\nPHP\nCopy\nAsk AI\nimport { Polar } from \"@polar-sh/sdk\";\n\nconst polar = new Polar({\naccessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN!,\nserver: \"sandbox\", // omit or use 'production' for live\n});\n\n\n​\nPagination\nList endpoints in the Polar API support pagination to help you efficiently retrieve large datasets. Use the page and limit query parameters to control pagination.\n​\nQuery Parameters\nParameter\tType\tDefault\tMax\tDescription\npage\tinteger\t1\t-\tPage number, starting from 1\nlimit\tinteger\t10\t100\tNumber of items to return per page (window size)\nThe page parameter works as a window offset. For example, page=2&limit=10 means the API will skip the first 10 elements and return the next 10.\n​\nResponse Format\nAll paginated responses include a pagination object with metadata about the current page and total results:\nField\tType\tDescription\ntotal_count\tinteger\tTotal number of items matching your query across all pages\nmax_page\tinteger\tTotal number of pages available, given the current limit value\n​\nExample\nLet’s say you want to fetch products with a limit of 100 items per page:\nRequest\nResponse\nCopy\nAsk AI\ncurl https://api.polar.sh/v1/products/?page=1&limit=100 \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $POLAR_OAT\" \\\n  -H \"Accept: application/json\"\n\nIn this example:\ntotal_count=250 indicates there are 250 total products\nlimit=100 means each page contains up to 100 products\nmax_page=3 means you need to make 3 requests to retrieve all products (pages 1, 2, and 3)\nTo retrieve all pages, increment the page parameter from 1 to max_page. Our SDKs provide built-in pagination helpers to automatically iterate through all pages.\n​\nRate Limits\nPolar API has rate limits to ensure fair usage and maintain performance. The limits are as follows:\n300 requests per minute per organization/customer or OAuth2 Client.\n3 requests per second for unauthenticated license key validation, activation, and deactivation endpoints.\nIf you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a 429 Too Many Requests response. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long you should wait before making another request.\nOrganizations requiring higher rate limits for production workloads may contact our support team to discuss elevated limits.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nCreate Checkout Session\nCreate a checkout session. **Scopes**: `checkouts:write`\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

Checkout Links might not be the right tool for you. Instead, you should use the Checkout API.\n​\nCreate a Checkout Link\nCheckout Links can be managed from the Checkout Links tabs of the Products section. Click on New Link to create a new one.\n​\nLabel\nThis is an internal name for the Checkout Link. It’s only visible to you.\n​\nProducts\nYou can select one or several products. With several products, customers will be able to switch between them on the checkout page.\n​\nDiscount\nYou can disable discount codes, if you wish to prevent customers from using them.\nYou can also preset a discount: it’ll be automatically applied when the customer lands on the checkout page.\n​\nMetadata\nThis is an optional key-value object allowing you to store additional information which may be useful for you when handling the order. This metadata will be copied to the generated Checkout object and, if the checkout succeeds, to the resulting Order and/or Subscription.\n​\nUsing Checkout Links\nYou can share the Checkout Link URL on your webpage, social media, or directly to customers.\nCheckout Links will go against our API, and redirect to short-lived Checkout session. This means that the Checkout page the user will end up on, are temporary and expires after a while if no successful purchase is made.\nThis means that you need to make sure to always use this Checkout Link URL (as shown above). If you mistakenly copy the URL from a Checkout Session, the link will expire.\n​\nQuery parameters\nYou can pass optional query parameters to your Checkout Links.\n​\nPrepopulate fields\nYou can prefill the checkout fields with the following query parameters:\n​\ncustomer_email\nstring\nPrefill customer email at checkout\n​\ncustomer_name\nstring\nPrefill customer name at checkout\n​\ndiscount_code\nstring\nPrefill discount code\n​\namount\nstring\nPrefill amount in case of Pay What You Want pricing\n​\ncustom_field_data.{slug}\nstring\nPrefill checkout fields data, where {slug} is the slug of the custom field.\n​\nStore attribution and reference metadata\nThe following query parameters will automatically be set on Checkout metadata.\n​\nreference_id\nstring\nYour own reference ID for the checkout session.\n​\nutm_source\nstring\nUTM source of the checkout session.\n​\nutm_medium\nstring\nUTM medium of the checkout session.\n​\nutm_campaign\nstring\nUTM campaign of the checkout session.\n​\nutm_content\nstring\nUTM content of the checkout session.\n​\nutm_term\nstring\nUTM term of the checkout session.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nPrevious\nEmbedded Checkout\nEmbed our checkout directly on your site\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

    "html": "Checkout\nEmbedded Checkout\nCopy page\n\nEmbed our checkout directly on your site\n\nYou can either copy and paste our code snippet to get up and running in a second or use our JavaScript library for more advanced integrations. Our embedded checkout allows you to provide a seamless purchasing experience without redirecting users away from your site.\n​\nCode Snippet\nThe code snippet can be used on any website or CMS that allows you to insert HTML.\nFirst, create a Checkout Link as described in the previous section. The code snippet can directly be copied from there by clicking on Copy Embed Code.\nThe snippet looks like this:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n<a\n  href=\"__CHECKOUT_LINK__\"\n  data-polar-checkout\n  data-polar-checkout-theme=\"light\"\n>\n  Purchase\n</a>\n<script\n  src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@polar-sh/checkout@0.1/dist/embed.global.js\"\n  defer\n  data-auto-init\n></script>\n\nThis will display a Purchase link which will open an inline checkout when clicked.\nYou can style the trigger element any way you want, as long as you keep the data-polar-checkout attribute.\n​\nImport Library\nIf you have a more advanced project in JavaScript, like a React app, adding the <script> tag may not be an option. In this case, you can install our dedicated library.\nnpm\npnpm\nyarn\nCopy\nAsk AI\nnpm install @polar-sh/checkout\n\nThen, you should import the PolarEmbedCheckout helper class and manually call PolarEmbedCheckout.init(). This will add the required handlers on elements having the data-polar-checkout attribute.\nHere is an example in React:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nimport { PolarEmbedCheckout } from '@polar-sh/checkout/embed'\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\n\nconst PurchaseLink = () => {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    PolarEmbedCheckout.init()\n  }, [])\n\n  return (\n    <a\n      href=\"__CHECKOUT_LINK__\"\n      data-polar-checkout\n      data-polar-checkout-theme=\"light\"\n    >\n      Purchase\n    </a>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default PurchaseLink\n\nInstead of a Checkout Link, you can also use a Checkout Session URL created dynamically from the API.\nFor this to work, make sure to set the embed_origin parameter correctly when creating the Checkout Session. For example, if your checkout page is served on the URL https://example.com/checkout, you should set embed_origin to https://example.com.\n​\nAdvanced Integration\nFor users who need more control over the embedded checkout flow, the PolarEmbedCheckout class provides several advanced features.\n​\nProgrammatically creating an embed\nInstead of using declarative triggers with data-polar-checkout attributes, you can programmatically create and control checkout instances:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nimport { PolarEmbedCheckout } from \"@polar-sh/checkout/embed\";\n\n// Open checkout programmatically when needed\nconst openCheckout = async () => {\n  const checkoutLink = \"__CHECKOUT_LINK__\";\n  const theme = \"light\"; // or 'dark'\n\n  try {\n    // This creates the checkout iframe and returns a Promise\n    // that resolves when the checkout is fully loaded\n    const checkout = await PolarEmbedCheckout.create(checkoutLink, theme);\n\n    // Now you can interact with the checkout instance\n    return checkout;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Failed to open checkout\", error);\n  }\n};\n\n// Example: Trigger checkout when a button is clicked\ndocument.getElementById(\"buy-button\").addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  openCheckout();\n});\n\n​\nListening for checkout events\nYou can listen for checkout events to respond to user interactions:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nimport { PolarEmbedCheckout } from \"@polar-sh/checkout/embed\";\n\nconst openCheckoutWithEvents = async () => {\n  const checkout = await PolarEmbedCheckout.create(\"__CHECKOUT_LINK__\");\n\n  // Listen for when the checkout is loaded\n  checkout.addEventListener(\"loaded\", (event) => {\n    console.log(\"Checkout loaded\");\n    // Call event.preventDefault() if you want to prevent the standard behavior\n    // event.preventDefault()\n    // Note: This would prevent removing the loader if it's still visible\n  });\n\n  // Listen for when the checkout has been closed\n  checkout.addEventListener(\"close\", (event) => {\n    console.log(\"Checkout has been closed\");\n    // Call event.preventDefault() if you want to prevent the standard behavior\n    // event.preventDefault()\n  });\n\n  // Listen for when the checkout has been confirmed (payment processing)\n  checkout.addEventListener(\"confirmed\", (event) => {\n    console.log(\"Order confirmed, processing payment\");\n    // Call event.preventDefault() if you want to prevent the standard behavior\n    // event.preventDefault()\n    // Note: This would prevent setting the checkout as non-closable\n  });\n\n  // Listen for successful completion\n  checkout.addEventListener(\"success\", (event) => {\n    console.log(\"Purchase successful!\", event.detail);\n\n    // Call event.preventDefault() if you want to prevent the standard behavior\n    // event.preventDefault()\n    // Note: For success event, this prevents automatic redirection if redirect is true\n\n    // If redirect is false, you can show your own success message\n    if (!event.detail.redirect) {\n      showSuccessMessage();\n    }\n    // Otherwise, the user will be redirected to the success URL (unless prevented)\n  });\n\n  return checkout;\n};\n\n​\nReact Integration with event handling\nHere’s a more complete React example that handles checkout events:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nimport { PolarEmbedCheckout } from '@polar-sh/checkout/embed'\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n\nconst CheckoutButton = () => {\n  const [checkoutInstance, setCheckoutInstance] = useState(null)\n\n  // Clean up checkout instance on unmount\n  useEffect(() => {\n    return () => {\n      if (checkoutInstance) {\n        checkoutInstance.close()\n      }\n    }\n  }, [checkoutInstance])\n\n  const handleCheckout = async () => {\n      try {\n        const checkout = await PolarEmbedCheckout.create(\n          '__CHECKOUT_LINK__',\n          'light'\n        )\n\n      setCheckoutInstance(checkout)\n\n      checkout.addEventListener('success', (event) => {\n        // Track successful purchase\n        analytics.track('Purchase Completed', {\n          productId: 'your-product-id',\n          // Add other analytics data\n        })\n\n        // Show success message or redirect\n        if (!event.detail.redirect) {\n          // Handle success in your app\n        }\n      })\n\n      checkout.addEventListener('close', (event) => {\n        // Clean up our reference when checkout is closed\n        setCheckoutInstance(null)\n      })\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error('Failed to open checkout', error)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleCheckout}>\n      Complete Purchase\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default CheckoutButton\n\n​\nProgrammatically closing checkout\nIn some cases, you might need to programmatically close the checkout - for instance, if you detect that a user needs to take an action elsewhere in your application first:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nimport { PolarEmbedCheckout } from \"@polar-sh/checkout/embed\";\n\n// Example: open checkout and store the instance\nlet activeCheckout = null;\n\nasync function openCheckout() {\n  const checkout = await PolarEmbedCheckout.create(\"__CHECKOUT_LINK__\");\n  activeCheckout = checkout;\n  return checkout;\n}\n\n// Later, close it programmatically when needed\nfunction closeCheckout() {\n  if (activeCheckout) {\n    activeCheckout.close();\n    // The 'close' event will fire automatically\n    // Don't set activeCheckout to null here, as we'll handle that in the event listener\n  }\n}\n\n// Add a listener to update our reference when checkout is closed\nfunction setupCheckout(checkout) {\n  checkout.addEventListener(\"close\", (event) => {\n    // Reset our reference when checkout is closed\n    activeCheckout = null;\n  });\n  return checkout;\n}\n\n// Example usage\ndocument.getElementById(\"open-checkout\").addEventListener(\"click\", async () => {\n  const checkout = await openCheckout();\n  setupCheckout(checkout);\n});\ndocument\n  .getElementById(\"close-checkout\")\n  .addEventListener(\"click\", closeCheckout);\n\n​\nEnabling Wallet Payment Methods (Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.)\nWallet payment methods such as Apple Pay and Google Pay are supported in the checkout with the following conditions:\nApple Pay appears automatically in the checkout if:\nThe user is on an Apple device\nThe browser is Safari\nThe device is connected to an Apple account with Apple Pay configured\nGoogle Pay appears automatically in the checkout if:\nThe user is on Google Chrome\nThe browser is connected to a Google account with Google Pay configured\nNo additional action is required if you meet these conditions and are not using an embedded checkout.\n​\nEnabling Wallet Payments for Embedded Checkout\nBy default, wallet payment methods (Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.) are not enabled when you embed our checkout form into your website. For security reasons, your website domain needs to be manually validated before enabling these payment methods in embedded mode.\nTo enable wallet payment methods on your embedded checkout, please email us with:\nYour organization slug\nThe domain you wish to allow for wallet payments\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nPrevious\nCheckout API\nCreate checkout sessions programmatically for complete control\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

    "html": "Framework Guides\nIntegrate Polar with Next.js\nCopy page\n\nIn this guide, we’ll show you how to integrate Polar with Next.js.\n\nFeel free to use our quick-start script to get started inside a new Next.js project:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n# Inside a new Next.js project\nnpx polar-init\n\nConsider following this guide while using the Polar Sandbox Environment. This will allow you to test your integration without affecting your production data.\nA complete code-example of this guide can be found on GitHub.\n​\nInstall the Polar JavaScript SDK\nTo get started, you need to install the Polar JavaScript SDK and the Polar Nextjs helper package. You can do this by running the following command:\nCopy\nAsk AI\npnpm install @polar-sh/sdk @polar-sh/nextjs\n\n​\nSetting up environment variables\n​\nPolar Access Token\nTo authenticate with Polar, you need to create an access token, and supply it to Next.js using a POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable.\nYou can create an organization access token from your organization settings.\n​\nConfiguring a Polar API Client\nTo interact with the Polar API, you need to create a new instance of the Polar class. This class uses the provided access token to authenticate with the Polar API.\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// src/polar.ts\nimport { Polar } from \"@polar-sh/sdk\";\n\nexport const api = new Polar({\n  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN!,\n  server: \"sandbox\", // Use this option if you're using the sandbox environment - else use 'production' or omit the parameter\n});\n\nRemember to replace sandbox with production when you’re ready to switch to the production environment.\n​\nGenerating Polar Checkout Sessions\nNext up, we need to create a checkout endpoint to handle the creation of checkout sessions.\nGo ahead and create a new GET route in Next.js.\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// src/app/checkout/route.ts\nimport { Checkout } from \"@polar-sh/nextjs\";\n\nexport const GET = Checkout({\n  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN!,\n  successUrl: \"/confirmation?checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}\",\n  server: \"sandbox\", // Use this option if you're using the sandbox environment - else use 'production' or omit the parameter\n});\n\n​\nHandling Polar Webhooks\nPolar can send you events about various things happening in your organization. This is very useful for keeping your database in sync with Polar checkouts, orders, subscriptions, etc.\nConfiguring a webhook is simple. Head over to your organization’s settings page and click on the “Add Endpoint” button to create a new webhook.\n​\nTunneling webhook events to your local development environment\nIf you’re developing locally, you can use a tool like ngrok to tunnel webhook events to your local development environment. This will allow you to test your webhook handlers without deploying them to a live server.\nRun the following command to start an ngrok tunnel:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nngrok http 3000\n\n​\nAdd Webhook Endpoint\nPoint the Webhook to your-app.com/api/webhook/polar. This must be an absolute URL which Polar can reach. If you use ngrok, the URL will look something like this: https://<your-ngrok-id>.ngrok-free.app/api/webhook/polar.\nSelect which events you want to be notified about. You can read more about the available events in the Events section.\nGenerate a secret key to sign the requests. This will allow you to verify that the requests are truly coming from Polar.\nAdd the secret key to your environment variables.\nCopy\nAsk AI\n# .env\nPOLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=\"polar_pat...\"\nPOLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=\"...\"\n\n​\nSetting up the Webhook handler\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// src/app/api/webhook/polar/route.ts\nimport { Webhooks } from \"@polar-sh/nextjs\";\n\nexport const POST = Webhooks({\n\twebhookSecret: process.env.POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET,\n\tonPayload: async (payload) => // Handle payload...\n});\n\nThe webhook event is now verified and you can proceed to handle the payload data.\n​\nHandling Webhook Events\nDepending on which events you’ve subscribed to, you’ll receive different payloads. This is where you can update your database, send notifications, etc.\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// src/app/api/webhook/polar/route.ts\nimport { Webhooks } from \"@polar-sh/nextjs\";\n\nexport const POST = Webhooks({\n  webhookSecret: process.env.POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET,\n  onPayload: async (payload) => ...,\n  onOrderCreated: async (order) => ...,\n  onCustomerStateChanged: async (customerState) => ...,\n  ...\n});\n\n​\nNotifying the client about the event\nIf you’re building a real-time application, you might want to notify the client about the event. On the confirmation-page, you can listen for the checkout.updated event and update the UI accordingly when it reaches the succeeded status.\n​\nConclusion\nIf you have issues or need support, feel free to join our Discord.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nPrevious\nLaravel\nIn this guide, we'll show you how to integrate Polar with Laravel.\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

    "html": "Usage Based Billing\nIntroduction\nCopy page\n\nUsage based billing using ingested events\n\nUsage Based Billing is a new feature. We have a lot in store and welcome feedback!\n​\nOverview\nPolar has a powerful Usage Based Billing infrastructure that allows you to charge your customers based on the usage of your application.\nThis is done by ingesting events from your application, creating Meters to represent that usage, and then adding metered prices to Products to charge for it.\n​\nConcepts\n​\nEvents\nEvents are the core of Usage Based Billing. They represent some usage done by a customer in your application. Typical examples of events are:\nA customer consumed AI LLM tokens\nA customer streamed minutes of video\nA customer uploaded a file to your application\nEvents are sent to Polar using the Events Ingestion API and are stored in our database. An event consists of the following fields:\nA name, which is a string that can be used to identify the type of event. For example, ai_usage, video_streamed or file_uploaded.\nA customer_id or external_customer_id, which is Polar’s customer ID or your user’s ID. This is used to identify the customer that triggered the event.\nA metadata object, which is a JSON object that can contain any additional information about the event. This is useful for storing information that can be used to filter the events or compute the actual usage. For example, you can store the duration of the video streamed or the size of the file uploaded.\nHere is an example of an event:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n{\n  \"name\": \"ai_usage\",\n  \"external_customer_id\": \"cus_123\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4.1-nano\",\n    \"requests\": 1,\n    \"total_tokens\": 77,\n    \"request_tokens\": 58,\n    \"response_tokens\": 19\n  }\n}\n\n​\nMeters\nMeters are there to filter and aggregate the events that are ingested. Said another way, this is how you define what usage you want to charge for, based on the events you send to Polar. For example:\nAI usage meter, which filters the events with the name ai_usage and sums the total_tokens field.\nVideo streaming meter, which filters the events with the name video_streamed and sums the duration field.\nFile upload meter, which filters the events with the name file_uploaded and sums the size field.\nYou can create and manage your meters from the dashboard. Polar is then able to compute the usage over time, both globally and per customer.\n​\nMetered Price\nA metered price is a price that is based on the usage of a meter, which is computed by filtering aggregating the events that are ingested. This is how you charge your customers for the usage of your application.\n​\nMeter Credits benefit\nYou can give credits to your customers on a specific meter. This is done by creating a Meter Credits Benefit, which is a special type of benefit that allows you to give credits to your customers on a specific meter.\nOn a recurring product, the customer will be credited the amount of units specified in the benefit at the beginning of every subscription cycle period — monthly or yearly.\n​\nQuickstart\nGet up and running in 5 minutes\n1\n\nCreate a Meter\n\nMeters consist of filters and an aggregation function. The filter is used to filter the events that should be included in the meter and the aggregation function is used to compute the usage.\n2\n\nAdd metered price to a Product\n\nTo enable usage based billing for a Product, you need to add a metered price to the Product. Metered prices are only applicable to Subscription Products.\n3\n\nIngest Events\n\nNow you’re ready to ingest events from your application. Sending events which match the meter’s filter will increment the meter’s usage for the customer.\n4\n\nCustomer Usage\n\nCustomers can view their estimated charges for each meter in the Customer Portal.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nPrevious\nEvent Ingestion\nIngest events from your application\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

    "html": "Guides\nImplementing Seat-Based Pricing\nCopy page\n\nComplete guide to implementing team products with seat-based pricing\n\nThis guide walks you through implementing seat-based pricing for team products, from creating the product to handling seat assignments and claims.\n​\nWhat you’ll build\nBy the end of this guide, you’ll have:\nA seat-based product with tiered pricing (subscription or one-time)\nCheckout flow for purchasing seats\nSeat assignment and management interface\nClaim flow for team members\nThis guide covers both subscription-based and one-time purchase seat-based products. The implementation is similar for both, with key differences in scaling and billing.\n​\nPrerequisites\nPolar organization with seat_based_pricing_enabled feature flag\nPolar SDK installed (npm install @polar-sh/sdk or pip install polar-sdk)\nImportant: Seat-based pricing requires the latest version of the SDK. Make sure to update to the latest version to access all seat-based pricing features.\nBasic understanding of Polar products and subscriptions\nSeat-based pricing is controlled by a feature flag. Contact support to enable it for your organization.\n​\nStep 1: Create a seat-based product\n1\n\nNavigate to Products\n\nIn the Polar dashboard, go to Products and click Create Product.\n2\n\nConfigure basic settings\n\nSet your product name, description, and media. For example:\nSubscription: Team Pro Plan - Professional features for your entire team\nOne-time: Enterprise License Pack - Perpetual team licenses\n3\n\nSelect seat-based pricing\n\nUnder Pricing:\nProduct type: Choose Subscription for recurring billing or One-time for perpetual licenses\nBilling cycle (subscriptions only): Monthly or Yearly\nPricing type: Seat-based\nMin seats: 1 (or your minimum team size)\n4\n\nConfigure pricing tiers\n\nDefine your volume-based pricing:\nTier\tMax Seats\tPrice per Seat\n1\t4\t$10/month\n2\t9\t$9/month\n3\tUnlimited\t$8/month\nExample: A team purchasing 6 seats pays 6 × \n9\n=\n9=54/month.\n5\n\nAdd benefits\n\nConfigure benefits that seat holders will receive:\nLicense Keys\nFile Downloads\nDiscord roles\nCustom benefits\nBenefits are granted when seats are claimed, not at purchase time.\nYou can also create seat-based products via API:\nSubscription example:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nconst subscriptionProduct = await polar.products.create({\n  name: \"Team Pro Plan\",\n  organization_id: \"org_123\",\n  is_recurring: true,\n  prices: [{\n    type: \"recurring\",\n    recurring_interval: \"month\",\n    amount_type: \"seat_based\",\n    price_currency: \"usd\",\n    seat_tiers: [\n      { min_seats: 1, max_seats: 4, price_per_seat: 1000 },   // $10/month\n      { min_seats: 5, max_seats: 9, price_per_seat: 900 },    // $9/month\n      { min_seats: 10, max_seats: null, price_per_seat: 800 } // $8/month\n    ]\n  }]\n});\n\nOne-time purchase example:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nconst oneTimeProduct = await polar.products.create({\n  name: \"Enterprise License Pack\",\n  organization_id: \"org_123\",\n  is_recurring: false,\n  prices: [{\n    type: \"one_time\",\n    amount_type: \"seat_based\",\n    price_currency: \"usd\",\n    seat_tiers: [\n      { min_seats: 1, max_seats: 10, price_per_seat: 5000 },   // $50 per seat\n      { min_seats: 11, max_seats: 50, price_per_seat: 4500 },  // $45 per seat\n      { min_seats: 51, max_seats: null, price_per_seat: 4000 } // $40 per seat\n    ]\n  }]\n});\n\n​\nStep 2: Implement checkout flow\nCreate a checkout session that allows customers to select seat quantity:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nconst checkout = await polar.checkouts.create({\n  product_price_id: \"price_123\",\n  seats: 5, // Customer selects quantity\n  success_url: \"https://yourapp.com/success\",\n  customer_email: \"billing@company.com\"\n});\n\n// Redirect to checkout.url\n\nThe checkout displays:\nPrice per seat based on quantity\nTotal amount\nClear indication this is for team access\nThe checkout automatically calculates pricing based on your tiers. A customer selecting 5 seats will see the \n9\n/\n𝑠\n𝑒\n𝑎\n𝑡\n𝑝\n𝑟\n𝑖\n𝑐\n𝑒\n,\n𝑡\n𝑜\n𝑡\n𝑎\n𝑙\n𝑖\n𝑛\n𝑔\n9/seatprice,totaling45.\n​\nStep 3: Handle post-purchase webhook\nListen for purchase webhooks to know when a customer buys seats:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// Webhook handler\napp.post('/webhooks/polar', async (req, res) => {\n  const event = req.body;\n\n  // For subscriptions\n  if (event.type === 'subscription.created') {\n    const subscription = event.data;\n\n    if (subscription.product.has_seat_based_price) {\n      await notifyBillingManager(subscription.customer_id, {\n        message: `Your ${subscription.seats}-seat subscription is active!`,\n        manage_seats_url: `https://yourapp.com/seats/subscription/${subscription.id}`\n      });\n    }\n  }\n\n  // For one-time purchases\n  if (event.type === 'order.created') {\n    const order = event.data;\n\n    if (order.seats) {\n      await notifyBillingManager(order.customer_id, {\n        message: `Your ${order.seats} perpetual seat licenses have been purchased!`,\n        manage_seats_url: `https://yourapp.com/seats/order/${order.id}`\n      });\n    }\n  }\n\n  res.sendStatus(200);\n});\n\n​\nStep 4: Build seat management interface\nCreate an interface for billing managers to assign seats:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// List available seats (works for both subscriptions and orders)\nasync function getSeatInfo(params: { subscription_id?: string; order_id?: string }) {\n  const { seats, available_seats, total_seats } =\n    await polar.customerSeats.list(params);\n\n  return {\n    seats,\n    available: available_seats,\n    total: total_seats,\n    canAssign: available_seats > 0\n  };\n}\n\n// Assign a seat (works for both subscriptions and orders)\nasync function assignSeat(\n  params: { subscription_id?: string; order_id?: string },\n  email: string,\n  metadata?: Record<string, any>\n) {\n  try {\n    const seat = await polar.customerSeats.assign({\n      ...params,\n      email: email,\n      metadata: metadata // e.g., { department: \"Engineering\" }\n    });\n\n    return {\n      success: true,\n      seat: seat,\n      message: `Invitation sent to ${email}`\n    };\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error.status === 400) {\n      return {\n        success: false,\n        error: \"No seats available or customer already has a seat\"\n      };\n    }\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n// For subscriptions: getSeatInfo({ subscription_id: \"sub_123\" })\n// For orders: getSeatInfo({ order_id: \"order_456\" })\n\nExample UI component (React):\nCopy\nAsk AI\nfunction SeatManagement({ subscriptionId }: { subscriptionId: string }) {\n  const [seatInfo, setSeatInfo] = useState(null);\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState(\"\");\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    loadSeats();\n  }, [subscriptionId]);\n\n  async function loadSeats() {\n    const info = await getSeatInfo(subscriptionId);\n    setSeatInfo(info);\n  }\n\n  async function handleAssign() {\n    const result = await assignSeat(subscriptionId, email, {\n      role: \"Developer\"\n    });\n\n    if (result.success) {\n      setEmail(\"\");\n      loadSeats(); // Refresh list\n      toast.success(\"Invitation sent!\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Seat Management</h2>\n      <p>{seatInfo?.available} of {seatInfo?.total} seats available</p>\n\n      {/* Assign new seat */}\n      <div>\n        <input\n          type=\"email\"\n          value={email}\n          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n          placeholder=\"team-member@company.com\"\n        />\n        <button\n          onClick={handleAssign}\n          disabled={!seatInfo?.canAssign}\n        >\n          Assign Seat\n        </button>\n      </div>\n\n      {/* List existing seats */}\n      <table>\n        <thead>\n          <tr>\n            <th>Email</th>\n            <th>Status</th>\n            <th>Role</th>\n            <th>Actions</th>\n          </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n          {seatInfo?.seats.map(seat => (\n            <tr key={seat.id}>\n              <td>{seat.customer_email}</td>\n              <td>\n                <SeatStatusBadge status={seat.status} />\n              </td>\n              <td>{seat.seat_metadata?.role}</td>\n              <td>\n                {seat.status === 'pending' && (\n                  <button onClick={() => resendInvitation(seat.id)}>\n                    Resend\n                  </button>\n                )}\n                {seat.status === 'claimed' && (\n                  <button onClick={() => revokeSeat(seat.id)}>\n                    Revoke\n                  </button>\n                )}\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n          ))}\n        </tbody>\n      </table>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n​\nStep 5: Implement seat claim flow\nWhen a team member receives an invitation email, they’ll click a link with the invitation token. Build a claim page:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// Claim page route: /claim?token=abc123...\n\nasync function handleClaimPage(token: string) {\n  // Get claim information (no auth required)\n  const claimInfo = await polar.customerSeats.getClaimInfo({\n    invitation_token: token\n  });\n\n  if (!claimInfo.can_claim) {\n    return {\n      error: \"This invitation has expired or already been claimed\"\n    };\n  }\n\n  return {\n    product: claimInfo.product_name,\n    organization: claimInfo.organization_name,\n    email: claimInfo.customer_email\n  };\n}\n\nasync function claimSeat(token: string) {\n  const { seat, customer_session_token } =\n    await polar.customerSeats.claim({\n      invitation_token: token\n    });\n\n  // Store the customer session token\n  // This allows immediate portal access\n  localStorage.setItem('polar_session', customer_session_token);\n\n  return {\n    success: true,\n    seat: seat,\n    sessionToken: customer_session_token\n  };\n}\n\nExample claim page (React):\nCopy\nAsk AI\nfunction ClaimPage() {\n  const [token] = useSearchParams();\n  const [claimInfo, setClaimInfo] = useState(null);\n  const [claiming, setClaiming] = useState(false);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    loadClaimInfo();\n  }, [token]);\n\n  async function loadClaimInfo() {\n    const info = await handleClaimPage(token.get('token'));\n    setClaimInfo(info);\n  }\n\n  async function handleClaim() {\n    setClaiming(true);\n    try {\n      const result = await claimSeat(token.get('token'));\n\n      // Redirect to customer portal\n      window.location.href = `/portal?session=${result.sessionToken}`;\n    } catch (error) {\n      toast.error(\"Failed to claim seat\");\n      setClaiming(false);\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (claimInfo?.error) {\n    return <div>Error: {claimInfo.error}</div>;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>You've been invited!</h1>\n      <p>\n        Join {claimInfo?.organization}'s {claimInfo?.product} plan\n      </p>\n      <p>Email: {claimInfo?.email}</p>\n\n      <button onClick={handleClaim} disabled={claiming}>\n        {claiming ? \"Claiming...\" : \"Claim My Seat\"}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n​\nStep 6: Handle benefit granting\nAfter a seat is claimed, benefits are granted automatically via background jobs. Listen for webhooks to track this:\nCopy\nAsk AI\napp.post('/webhooks/polar', async (req, res) => {\n  const event = req.body;\n\n  if (event.type === 'benefit_grant.created') {\n    const grant = event.data;\n\n    // A team member received their benefits\n    console.log(`Benefit ${grant.benefit_id} granted to ${grant.customer_id}`);\n\n    // Update your app (e.g., create license, grant access)\n    await grantAccess(grant.customer_id, grant.benefit);\n  }\n\n  if (event.type === 'benefit_grant.revoked') {\n    const grant = event.data;\n\n    // A seat was revoked\n    await revokeAccess(grant.customer_id, grant.benefit);\n  }\n\n  res.sendStatus(200);\n});\n\n​\nStep 7: Implement seat revocation\nAllow billing managers to revoke seats:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nasync function revokeSeat(seatId: string) {\n  const revokedSeat = await polar.customerSeats.revoke({\n    seat_id: seatId\n  });\n\n  // Benefits are automatically revoked via webhook\n  return {\n    success: true,\n    seat: revokedSeat,\n    message: \"Seat revoked successfully\"\n  };\n}\n\nRevoking a seat immediately removes access but does not issue a refund. The billing manager continues to pay for all purchased seats.\n​\nStep 8: Handle scaling\nFor subscriptions, allow billing managers to add or reduce seats:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nasync function addSeats(subscriptionId: string, newTotal: number) {\n  // Update subscription seat count\n  const subscription = await polar.subscriptions.update({\n    id: subscriptionId,\n    seats: newTotal\n  });\n\n  // New seats are immediately available for assignment\n  return subscription;\n}\n\nasync function reduceSeats(subscriptionId: string, newTotal: number) {\n  const { seats } = await polar.customerSeats.list({\n    subscription_id: subscriptionId\n  });\n\n  const claimedCount = seats.filter(s => s.status === 'claimed').length;\n\n  if (newTotal < claimedCount) {\n    throw new Error(\n      `Cannot reduce to ${newTotal} seats. ${claimedCount} seats are currently claimed. Revoke seats first.`\n    );\n  }\n\n  // Update will take effect at next renewal\n  const subscription = await polar.subscriptions.update({\n    id: subscriptionId,\n    seats: newTotal\n  });\n\n  return subscription;\n}\n\nFor one-time purchases, customers buy additional seats via new orders:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nasync function purchaseMoreSeats(productId: string, additionalSeats: number) {\n  // Create a new checkout for additional seats\n  const checkout = await polar.checkouts.create({\n    product_id: productId,\n    seats: additionalSeats,\n    success_url: \"https://yourapp.com/success\"\n  });\n\n  // Each order is independent with its own seat pool\n  return checkout;\n}\n\nFor one-time purchases, each order has its own independent seat pool. Customers can purchase additional seats anytime by creating a new order. All seats remain perpetual.\n​\nBest Practices\n​\n1. Validate seat availability\nAlways check available seats before showing the assignment form:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nif (available_seats === 0) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      All seats are assigned.\n      <button onClick={upgradeSubscription}>\n        Add More Seats\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n​\n2. Use metadata effectively\nStore useful context in seat metadata:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nawait polar.customerSeats.assign({\n  subscription_id: subId,\n  email: \"dev@company.com\",\n  metadata: {\n    department: \"Engineering\",\n    role: \"Senior Developer\",\n    cost_center: \"R&D\",\n    manager: \"jane@company.com\"\n  }\n});\n\n​\n3. Handle expired tokens gracefully\nCopy\nAsk AI\ntry {\n  await claimSeat(token);\n} catch (error) {\n  if (error.status === 400) {\n    // Show resend option\n    return \"This invitation has expired. Contact your admin to resend.\";\n  }\n}\n\n​\n4. Track utilization\nMonitor seat usage to identify upsell opportunities:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nconst { seats, available_seats, total_seats } = await getSeatInfo(subId);\nconst utilization = ((total_seats - available_seats) / total_seats) * 100;\n\nif (utilization > 80) {\n  // Suggest adding more seats\n  showUpgradePrompt();\n}\n\n​\n5. Clear communication\nMake it clear to billing managers that:\nThey won’t receive direct access to benefits\nSeats must be assigned to team members\nRevocation doesn’t refund costs\nFor subscriptions: Reducing seats requires revoking claims first\nFor one-time purchases: Seats are perpetual and non-refundable\n​\nCommon Patterns\n​\nBulk seat assignment\nCopy\nAsk AI\nasync function assignMultipleSeats(\n  subscriptionId: string,\n  emails: string[]\n) {\n  const results = await Promise.allSettled(\n    emails.map(email =>\n      polar.customerSeats.assign({\n        subscription_id: subscriptionId,\n        email: email\n      })\n    )\n  );\n\n  const succeeded = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled');\n  const failed = results.filter(r => r.status === 'rejected');\n\n  return {\n    succeeded: succeeded.length,\n    failed: failed.length,\n    errors: failed.map(f => f.reason)\n  };\n}\n\n​\nSyncing with your user system\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// When a user joins your system\nasync function onUserSignup(email: string, organizationId: string) {\n  // Check if they have a pending seat\n  const subscriptions = await getOrganizationSubscriptions(organizationId);\n\n  for (const sub of subscriptions) {\n    const { seats } = await polar.customerSeats.list({\n      subscription_id: sub.id\n    });\n\n    const pendingSeat = seats.find(s =>\n      s.status === 'pending' && s.customer_email === email\n    );\n\n    if (pendingSeat) {\n      // Auto-claim on signup\n      const claimLink = `/claim?token=${pendingSeat.invitation_token}`;\n      return { shouldClaim: true, claimLink };\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n​\nCustom portal integration\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// Display team subscriptions in your app\nasync function getTeamSubscriptions(customerId: string) {\n  const subs = await polar.customerPortal.seats.listSubscriptions({\n    customer_id: customerId\n  });\n\n  return subs.map(sub => ({\n    product: sub.product.name,\n    status: sub.status,\n    role: sub.seat_metadata?.role,\n    expires: sub.current_period_end\n  }));\n}\n\n​\nTroubleshooting\n​\nSeats not appearing\nEnsure the feature flag is enabled:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nseat_based_pricing_enabled: true\n\n​\nBenefits not granted after claim\nCheck webhook logs for benefit_grant.created events. Benefits are granted asynchronously via background jobs.\n​\nCannot reduce seats\nMake sure to revoke seats before reducing the subscription seat count. You cannot reduce below the currently claimed count.\n​\nClaim link expired\nInvitation tokens expire after 24 hours. Have the billing manager resend the invitation:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nawait polar.customerSeats.resend({ seat_id: seatId });\n\n​\nNext Steps\nReview the Seat-Based Pricing Feature Documentation\nExplore the Customer Seats API Reference\nSet up webhook handlers for real-time updates\nLearn about Customer Portal customization\n​\nNeed Help?\nJoin our Discord community or contact support for assistance with seat-based pricing implementation.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nPrevious\nCreate product variants\nLearn how create product variants in Polar and how customers can easily switch between them in the customer portal.\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

This will allow you to test your integration without affecting your production data.\n​\nPolar Laravel Example App\nWe’ve created a simple example Laravel application that you can use as a reference.\nView Code on GitHub\n​\nSetting up environment variables\n​\nPolar API Key\nTo authenticate with Polar, you need to create an access token, and supply it to Laravel using a POLAR_API_KEY environment variable.\nYou can create an organization access token from your organization settings.\n​\nFetching Polar Products for display\n​\nCreating the Products Controller\nGo ahead and add the following entry in your routes/web.php file:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// routes/web.php\nRoute::get('/products', [ProductsController::class, 'handle']);\n\nNext up, create the ProductsController class in the app/Http/Controllers directory:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// app/Http/Controllers/ProductsController.php\n<?php\n\nnamespace App\\Http\\Controllers;\n\nuse Illuminate\\Http\\Request;\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Http;\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Log;\n\nclass ProductsController extends Controller\n{\n    public function handle(Request $request)\n    {\n        // Change from sandbox-api.polar.sh -> api.polar.sh when ready to go live\n        // And don't forget to update the .env file with the correct POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID and POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET\n        $data = Http::get('https://sandbox-api.polar.sh/v1/products', [\n            'is_archived' => false,\n        ]);\n\n        $products = $data->json();\n\n        return view('products', ['products' => $products['items']]);\n    }\n}\n\n​\nDisplaying Products\nFinally, create the products view in the resources/views directory:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// resources/views/products.blade.php\n@foreach ($products as $product)\n    <div>\n        <h3>{{ $product['name'] }}</h3>\n        <a href=\"/checkout?priceId={{ $product['prices'][0]['id'] }}\">Buy</a>\n    </div>\n@endforeach\n\nNotice that we create a link to /checkout with a query parameter priceId. This is the ID of the price that the user will be charged for when they click the “Buy” button. We will configure this route in the next section.\nThat’s it for the products page. You can now display the products to your users, and they will be able to buy them. Let’s now create the checkout endpoint.\n​\nGenerating Polar Checkout Sessions\nThis endpoint will be responsible for creating a new checkout session, redirecting the user to the Polar Checkout page & redirect back to a configured confirmation page.\nGo ahead and create a new entry in your routes/web.php file:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// routes/web.php\nRoute::get('/checkout', [CheckoutController::class, 'handle']);\n\nNext, create the CheckoutController class in the app/Http/Controllers directory:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// app/Http/Controllers/CheckoutController.php\n<?php\n\nnamespace App\\Http\\Controllers;\n\nuse Illuminate\\Http\\Request;\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Http;\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Log;\n\nclass CheckoutController extends Controller\n{\n    public function handle(Request $request)\n    {\n        $productPriceId = $request->query('priceId', '');\n        // Polar will replace {CHECKOUT_ID} with the actual checkout ID upon a confirmed checkout\n        $confirmationUrl = $request->getSchemeAndHttpHost() . '/confirmation?checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}';\n\n        // Change from sandbox-api.polar.sh -> api.polar.sh when ready to go live\n        // And don't forget to update the .env file with the correct POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID and POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET\n        $result = Http::withHeaders([\n            'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . env('POLAR_API_KEY'),\n            'Content-Type' => 'application/json',\n        ])->post('https://sandbox-api.polar.sh/v1/checkouts/custom/', [\n            'product_price_id' => $productPriceId,\n            'success_url' => $confirmationUrl,\n            'payment_processor' => 'stripe',\n        ]);\n\n        $data = $result->json();\n\n        $checkoutUrl = $data['url'];\n\n        return redirect($checkoutUrl);\n    }\n}\n\nWe can now easily create a checkout session & redirect there by creating a link to /checkout?priceId={priceId}. Just like we did when displaying the products above.\nUpon Checkout success, the user will be redirected to the confirmation page.\n​\nCreating the Confirmation Page\nCreate a new entry in your routes/web.php file:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// routes/web.php\nRoute::get('/confirmation', [ConfirmationController::class, 'handle']);\n\nNext, create the ConfirmationController class in the app/Http/Controllers directory:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// app/Http/Controllers/ConfirmationController.php\n<?php\n\nnamespace App\\Http\\Controllers;\n\nuse Illuminate\\Http\\Request;\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Http;\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Log;\n\nclass ConfirmationController extends Controller\n{\n    public function handle(Request $request)\n    {\n        // Change from sandbox-api.polar.sh -> api.polar.sh when ready to go live\n        // And don't forget to update the .env file with the correct POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID and POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET\n        $data = Http::withHeaders([\n            'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . env('POLAR_API_KEY'),\n            'Content-Type' => 'application/json',\n        ])->get('https://sandbox-api.polar.sh/v1/checkouts/custom/' . $request->query('checkout_id'));\n\n        $checkout = $data->json();\n\n        Log::info(json_encode($checkout, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT));\n\n        return view('confirmation', ['checkout' => $checkout]);\n    }\n}\n\nThe checkout is not considered “successful” yet however. It’s initially marked as confirmed until you’ve received a webhook event checkout.updated with a status set to succeeded. We’ll cover this in the next section.\n​\nHandling Polar Webhooks\nPolar can send you events about various things happening in your organization. This is very useful for keeping your database in sync with Polar checkouts, orders, subscriptions, etc.\nConfiguring a webhook is simple. Head over to your organization’s settings page and click on the “Add Endpoint” button to create a new webhook.\n​\nTunneling webhook events to your local development environment\nIf you’re developing locally, you can use a tool like ngrok to tunnel webhook events to your local development environment. This will allow you to test your webhook handlers without deploying them to a live server.\nRun the following command to start an ngrok tunnel:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nngrok http 3000\n\n​\nAdd Webhook Endpoint\nPoint the Webhook to your-app.com/api/webhook/polar. This must be an absolute URL which Polar can reach. If you use ngrok, the URL will look something like this: https://<your-ngrok-id>.ngrok-free.app/api/webhook/polar.\nSelect which events you want to be notified about. You can read more about the available events in the Events section.\nGenerate a secret key to sign the requests. This will allow you to verify that the requests are truly coming from Polar.\nAdd the secret key to your environment variables.\nCopy\nAsk AI\n# .env\nPOLAR_API_KEY=\"polar_oat...\"\nPOLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=\"...\"\n\n​\nSetting up the Webhook handler\nFirst, we need to install the standard-webhooks package to properly decode the incoming webhook payloads.\nCopy\nAsk AI\ncomposer require standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks:dev-main\n\nGo and add a routes/api.php file and add the following entry:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// routes/api.php\nRoute::webhooks('/webhook/polar');\n\nMake sure that it is included in the Bootstrap file.\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// bootstrap/app.php\n<?php\n\nuse Illuminate\\Foundation\\Application;\nuse Illuminate\\Foundation\\Configuration\\Exceptions;\nuse Illuminate\\Foundation\\Configuration\\Middleware;\n\nreturn Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))\n    ->withRouting(\n        web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',\n        api: __DIR__.'/../routes/api.php',\n        commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',\n        health: '/up',\n    )\n    ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {\n        //\n    })\n    ->withExceptions(function (Exceptions $exceptions) {\n        //\n    })->create();\n\nWe will use Spatie’s Webhook Client to handle the webhook events. It will automatically verify the signature of the requests, and dispatch the payload to a job queue for processing.\nCopy\nAsk AI\ncomposer require spatie/laravel-webhook-client\n\nLet’s publish the config:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nphp artisan vendor:publish --provider=\"Spatie\\WebhookClient\\WebhookClientServiceProvider\" --tag=\"webhook-client-config\"\n\nThis will create a new file called webhook-client.php in the config folder.\nWe need to adjust it to properly verify the signature of the requests.\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// config/webhook-client.php\n<?php\nreturn [\n    'configs' => [\n        [\n            /*\n             * This package supports multiple webhook receiving endpoints. If you only have\n             * one endpoint receiving webhooks, you can use 'default'.\n             */\n            'name' => 'default',\n\n            /*\n             * We expect that every webhook call will be signed using a secret. This secret\n             * is used to verify that the payload has not been tampered with.\n             */\n            'signing_secret' => env('POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET'),\n\n            /*\n             * The name of the header containing the signature.\n             */\n            'signature_header_name' => 'webhook-signature',\n\n            /*\n             *  This class will verify that the content of the signature header is valid.\n             *\n             * It should implement \\Spatie\\WebhookClient\\SignatureValidator\\SignatureValidator\n             */\n            // 'signature_validator' => \\Spatie\\WebhookClient\\SignatureValidator\\DefaultSignatureValidator::class,\n            'signature_validator' => App\\Handler\\PolarSignature::class,\n\n            /*\n             * This class determines if the webhook call should be stored and processed.\n             */\n            'webhook_profile' => \\Spatie\\WebhookClient\\WebhookProfile\\ProcessEverythingWebhookProfile::class,\n\n            /*\n             * This class determines the response on a valid webhook call.\n             */\n            'webhook_response' => \\Spatie\\WebhookClient\\WebhookResponse\\DefaultRespondsTo::class,\n\n            /*\n             * The classname of the model to be used to store webhook calls. The class should\n             * be equal or extend Spatie\\WebhookClient\\Models\\WebhookCall.\n             */\n            'webhook_model' => \\Spatie\\WebhookClient\\Models\\WebhookCall::class,\n\n            /*\n             * In this array, you can pass the headers that should be stored on\n             * the webhook call model when a webhook comes in.\n             *\n             * To store all headers, set this value to `*`.\n             */\n            'store_headers' => [],\n\n            /*\n             * The class name of the job that will process the webhook request.\n             *\n             * This should be set to a class that extends \\Spatie\\WebhookClient\\Jobs\\ProcessWebhookJob.\n             */\n            'process_webhook_job' => App\\Handler\\ProcessWebhook::class,\n        ],\n    ],\n\n    /*\n     * The integer amount of days after which models should be deleted.\n     *\n     * 7 deletes all records after 1 week. Set to null if no models should be deleted.\n     */\n    'delete_after_days' => 30,\n];\n\n​\nPreparing the database\nBy default, all webhook calls get saved into the database. So, we need to publish the migration that will hold the records. So run:\nCopy\nAsk AI\nphp artisan vendor:publish --provider=\"Spatie\\WebhookClient\\WebhookClientServiceProvider\" --tag=\"webhook-client-migrations\"\n\nThis will create a new migration file in the “database/migration” folder.\nThen run php artisan migrate to run the migration.\n​\nSetting up the queue system\nBefore we set up our job handler — let’s set up our queue system\nGo to your “.env” file and set the QUEUE_CONNECTION=database — you can decide to use other connections like redis.\nLet’s create our jobs table by running php artisan queue:table and then run the migration using php artisan migrate.\n​\nCreate the Handlers\nThe next thing we do is to create a folder named Handler inside the app folder. Then inside this app/Handler, create two files which are\nPolarSignature.php\nProcessWebhook.php\nInside app/Handler/PolarSignature.php, what we want to do is to validate that the request came from Polar. Add the code to that file.\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// app/Handler/PolarSignature.php\n<?php\n\nnamespace App\\Handler;\n\nuse Illuminate\\Http\\Request;\nuse Spatie\\WebhookClient\\Exceptions\\WebhookFailed;\nuse Spatie\\WebhookClient\\WebhookConfig;\nuse Spatie\\WebhookClient\\SignatureValidator\\SignatureValidator;\n\nclass PolarSignature implements SignatureValidator\n{\n    public function isValid(Request $request, WebhookConfig $config): bool\n    {\n        $signingSecret = base64_encode($config->signingSecret);\n        $wh = new \\StandardWebhooks\\Webhook($signingSecret);\n\n        return boolval( $wh->verify($request->getContent(), array(\n            \"webhook-id\" => $request->header(\"webhook-id\"),\n            \"webhook-signature\" => $request->header(\"webhook-signature\"),\n            \"webhook-timestamp\" => $request->header(\"webhook-timestamp\"),\n        )));\n    }\n}\n\nGreat. So the other file app/Handler/ProcessWebhook.php extends the ProcessWebhookJob class which holds the WebhookCall variables containing each job’s detail.\nCopy\nAsk AI\n// app/Handler/ProcessWebhook.php\n<?php\n\nnamespace App\\Handler;\n\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Log;\nuse Spatie\\WebhookClient\\Jobs\\ProcessWebhookJob;\n\nclass ProcessWebhook extends ProcessWebhookJob\n{\n    public function handle()\n    {\n        $decoded = json_decode($this->webhookCall, true);\n        $data = $decoded['payload'];\n\n        switch ($data['type']) {\n            case \"checkout.created\":\n                // Handle the checkout created event\n                break;\n            case \"checkout.updated\":\n                // Handle the checkout updated event\n                break;\n            case \"subscription.created\":\n                // Handle the subscription created event\n                break;\n            case \"subscription.updated\":\n                // Handle the subscription updated event\n                break;\n            case \"subscription.active\":\n                // Handle the subscription active event\n                break;\n            case \"subscription.revoked\":\n                // Handle the subscription revoked event\n                break;\n            case \"subscription.canceled\":\n                // Handle the subscription canceled event\n                break;\n            default:\n                // Handle unknown event\n                Log::info($data['type']);\n                break;\n        }\n\n        //Acknowledge you received the response\n        http_response_code(200);\n    }\n}\n\nOur application is ready to receive webhook requests.\nDon’t forget to run php artisan queue:listen to process the jobs.\n​\nTips\nIf you’re keeping track of active and inactive subscriptions in your database, make sure to handle the subscription.active and subscription.revoked events accordingly.\nThe cancellation of a subscription is handled by the subscription.canceled event. The user has probably canceled their subscription before the end of the billing period. Do not revoke any kind of access immediately, but rather wait until the end of the billing period or when you receive the subscription.revoked event.\n​\nNotifying the client about the event\nIf you’re building a real-time application, you might want to notify the client about the event. On the confirmation-page, you can listen for the checkout.updated event and update the UI accordingly when it reaches the succeeded status.\n​\nPolar Laravel Example App\nWe’ve created a simple example Laravel application that you can use as a reference\nView Code on GitHub\nIf you have issues or need support, feel free to join our Discord.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nPrevious\nSetup an endpoint\nGet notifications asynchronously when events occur instead of having to poll for updates\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

    "html": "Usage Based Billing\nBilling\nCopy page\n\nHow billing works with Usage Based\n\n​\nMetered Pricing\nMetered Pricing is a pricing model where you charge your customers based on the usage of your application.\nThere are a few different pricing models unique to Usage Based Billing:\nUnit Pricing\nVolume Pricing (coming soon)\n​\nUnit Pricing\nUnit pricing is a simple pricing model where you charge a fixed amount for each unit of usage.\nFor example:\nProduct Meter\tPrice per unit\nprompt-tokens\t$0.10\ncompletion-tokens\t$0.18\nThis means that every unit of prompt-tokens consumed by a customer will be charged at $0.10 and every unit of completion-tokens will be charged at $0.18.\nIt’s a linear pricing model, where the price per unit is fixed.\n​\nVolume Pricing (coming soon)\nVolume pricing is a pricing model where you charge a fixed amount for a certain volume of usage. Volume pricing is not yet available, but will be coming soon.\n​\nInvoicing Customers for Usage\nOur Usage Based Billing infrastructure is built to work with Subscription products out of the box.\n​\nAdd a metered price to your product\nTo charge your customers for usage, you need to add a metered price to your product. You’ll need the select the Meter and the amount per unit.\nOptionally, you can set a cap. The customer will be charged the cap amount if they exceed it, regardless of the usage.\n​\nMonthly Invoicing\nIf a customer has a subscription with a monthly billing period, usage is aggregated monthly and invoiced at the end of the month with the rest of the subscription.\n​\nYearly Invoicing\nIf a customer has a subscription with a yearly billing period, usage is aggregated yearly and invoiced at the end of the year with the rest of the subscription.\n​\nUsage Charges and Subscription Cancellation\nWhen a subscription is canceled, it generally remains active until the end of the current billing period (known as the grace period). During this grace period, all accumulated usage-based charges continue to be tracked. A final invoice will be issued at the end of that period to cover the consumed usage, even if the subscription will not be renewed. This ensures no pending usage charges are lost.\nIf a discount is applied on the subscription, it’ll be applied on the whole invoice, including metered usage.\n​\nCustomer Portal\nCustomers can view their estimated charges for each meter in the Customer Portal.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nPrevious\nIntroduction\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

They represent some usage done by a customer in your application. Typical examples of events are:\nA customer consumed AI LLM tokens\nA customer streamed minutes of video\nA customer uploaded a file to your application\nEvents are sent to Polar using the Events Ingestion API and are stored in our database. An event consists of the following fields:\nA name, which is a string that can be used to identify the type of event. For example, ai_usage, video_streamed or file_uploaded.\nA customer_id or external_customer_id, which is Polar’s customer ID or your user’s ID. This is used to identify the customer that triggered the event.\nA metadata object, which is a JSON object that can contain any additional information about the event. This is useful for storing information that can be used to filter the events or compute the actual usage. For example, you can store the duration of the video streamed or the size of the file uploaded.\nHere is an example of an event:\nCopy\nAsk AI\n{\n  \"name\": \"ai_usage\",\n  \"external_customer_id\": \"cus_123\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4.1-nano\",\n    \"requests\": 1,\n    \"total_tokens\": 77,\n    \"request_tokens\": 58,\n    \"response_tokens\": 19\n  }\n}\n\n​\nIngest events using the Polar SDK\nTo ingest events, you can use the Polar SDKs.\n​\nTypeScript Example\nCopy\nAsk AI\nimport { Polar } from \"@polar-sh/sdk\";\n\nconst polar = new Polar({\n  accessToken: process.env[\"POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"] ?? \"\",\n});\n\nawait polar.events.ingest({\n  events: [\n    {\n      name: \"<value>\",\n      externalCustomerId: \"<id>\",\n      metadata: {\n        key: \"value\",\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n});\n\nYou are always responsible for checking the balance of your customers’ Usage Meter. As events always are ingested, we will never prohibit any customer’s action based on their Usage Meter balance.\n​\nIngestion Strategies\nTo make it easier to ingest events, we have created a set of ingestion strategies for common event sources.\nLearn more about our Ingestion Strategies.\n​\nGood to know\n​\nEvents are immutable\nOnce an event is ingested, it cannot be changed, nor can it be deleted.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nPrevious\nStrategy Introduction\nIngestion strategies for Usage Based Billing\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

    "html": "Usage Based Billing\nMeters\nCopy page\n\nCreating and managing meters for Usage Based Billing\n\nMeters are there to filter and aggregate the events that are ingested. Said another way, this is how you define what usage you want to charge for, based on the events you send to Polar. For example:\nAI usage meter, which filters the events with the name ai_usage and sums the total_tokens field.\nVideo streaming meter, which filters the events with the name video_streamed and sums the duration field.\nFile upload meter, which filters the events with the name file_uploaded and sums the size field.\nYou can create and manage your meters from the dashboard. Polar is then able to compute the usage over time, both globally and per customer.\n​\nCreating a Meter\nTo create a meter, navigate to the Meters page in the sidebar and click the “Create Meter” button.\n​\nFilters\nA filter is a set of clauses that are combined using conjunctions. They’re used to filter events that you’ve ingested into Polar.\n​\nClauses\nA clause is a condition that an event must meet to be included in the meter.\n​\nProperty\nProperties are the properties of the event that you want to filter on.\nIf you want to match on a metadata field, you can use the metadata key directly. No need to include a metadata. prefix.\n​\nOperator\nOperators are the operators that you want to use to filter the events.\nEquals\nNot equals\nGreater Than\nGreater Than or Equals\nLess Than\nLess Than or Equals\nContains\nDoes Not Contain\n​\nValue\nValues are automatically parsed in the filter builder. They’re parsed in the following order:\nNumber — Tries to parse the value as number\nBoolean — Checks if value is “true” or “false”\nString — Treats value as string as fallback\n​\nConjunctions\nA conjunction is a logical operator that combines two or more clauses.\nand — All clauses must be true for the event to be included.\nor — At least one clause must be true for the event to be included.\n​\nAggregation\nThe aggregation is the function that is used to aggregate the events that match the filter.\nFor example, if you want to count the number of events that match the filter, you can use the Count aggregation. If you want to sum the value of a metadata field, you can use the Sum aggregation.\nCount — Counts the number of events that match the filter.\nSum — Sums the value of a property.\nAverage — Computes the average value of a property.\nMinimum — Computes the minimum value of a property.\nMaximum — Computes the maximum value of a property.\nUnique — Counts the number of unique values of a property.\n\nExample\n\nIf you want to use a metadata property in the aggregation, you can use the metadata property directly. No need to include a metadata. prefix.\n​\nExample\nThe following Meter Filter & Aggregation will match events that have the name openai-usage and sum units over metadata property completionTokens.\nYou can Preview the events matched by the meter while creating it.\n​\nGood to know\nA few things to keep in mind when creating and managing meters:\n​\nRenaming a Meter\nUntil https://github.com/polarsource/polar/issues/6490 is fixed, please contact support to rename the meter for you.\n​\nUpdating a Meter\nYou may update a meter’s filters or aggregation function as long as the meter doesn’t have any processed events or does not have any customer purchase associated with it.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nPrevious\nCredits\nCrediting customers for Usage Based Billing\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

It allows you to give your customers the ability to pre-pay for usage instead of risk getting a hefty bill at the end of the month.\n​\nHow Credits Work\nWhen you ingest events into a Usage Meter, customers will be charged for the usage based on the product’s pricing model.\nHowever, sometimes you may want to give your customers the ability to pre-pay for usage instead of risk getting a hefty bill at the end of the month.\nWhen you issue Credits to a customer, we first deduct the Credits from their Usage Meter balance. If the Usage Meter balance reaches 0, the customer will be charged for the overage.\n​\nCredits-only spending\nTo avoid any overage charges, don’t create any Metered price on your product. This way, billing won’t be triggered at all for the meter\n​\nIssuing Credits with the Credits Benefit\nThe Credits benefit will credit a customer’s Usage Meter balance at different points in time depending on the type of product the benefit is attached to.\n​\nSubscription Products\nThe customer will be credited the amount of units specified in the benefit at the beginning of every subscription cycle period — monthly or yearly.\n​\nOne-Time Products\nThe customer will be credited the amount of units specified in the benefit once at the time of purchase.\n​\nTracking customer’s balance\nIn your application, you’ll likely need to track the customer’s balance for a given meter. The easiest way to do this is to use the Customer State, which will give you the overview of the customer, including the balance for each of their active meters.\nYou can also specifically query the meters balance using the Customer Meters API.\nPolar doesn’t block usage if the customer exceeds their balance. You’re responsible for implementing the logic you need to prevent usage if they exceed it.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nPrevious\nBilling\nHow billing works with Usage Based\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

We will then transfer the balance minus Stripe payout fees (see below) to your Stripe account & issue a payout on their side.\n​\nManual Withdrawal\nWe require this to be done manually since:\nUsers have requested control for easier accounting vs. frequent & small payouts\nGiving users control of Stripe payout fees\n​\nStripe Payout Fees\n$2 per month of active payout(s)\n0.25% + $0.25 per payout\nCross border fees (currency conversion): 0.25% (EU) - 1% in other countries.\nGiven the fixed costs, we want to default to manual payouts so you can control when you want to incur them and do it once vs. per each individual transaction in order to reduce the overall fees.\n​\nReverse invoices\nSince we’re the Merchant of Record, your customers get an invoice from Polar. Thus, for your accounting, you need to issue an invoice to Polar for the amount we paid out to you. To ease this process, we can automatically generate a reverse invoice for you, detailing the sells we made on your behalf, minus our fees.\nYou can generate them from the Payouts page under Finance in your Polar dashboard. Click on the ellipsis next to the payout you want to generate a reverse invoice for, and select Download invoice.\nA modal will open, allowing you to:\nSet your billing name and address.\nAdd information shown below your billing address.\nAdd notes shown at the bottom of the invoice.\nCustomize the invoice number. By default, we generate one like POLAR-0001, but you can change it to your own format and sequence.\nOnce the reverse invoice is generated, it cannot be changed. Make sure to double-check the information before generating it.\n​\nSample Reverse Invoice\n​\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow long do payouts take?\n\nCan I use my personal bank account to receive payouts?\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\nPrevious\nRaycast\nThe fastest way to access Polar from your keyboard\nNext\n⌘I\nx\ngithub\ndiscord\nPowered by Mintlify"

    "html": "ORMReference\nPrisma Client API reference\nUSE PRISMA ORM WITHOUT RUST BINARIES\n\nIf Prisma ORM's Rust engine binaries cause large bundle sizes, slow builds, or deployment issues (for example, in serverless or edge environments), you can use it without them using this configuration of your generator block:\n\ngenerator client {\n\n  provider   = \"prisma-client-js\" // or \"prisma-client\"\n\n  engineType = \"client\"\n\n}\n\n\nPrisma ORM without Rust binaries has been Generally Available since v6.16.0\n.\n\nNote that you need to use a driver adapter in this case.\n\nWhen using this architecture:\n\nNo Rust query engine binary is downloaded or shipped.\nThe database connection pool is maintained by the native JS database driver you install (e.g., @prisma/adapter-pg for PostgreSQL).\n\nThis setup can simplify deployments in serverless or edge runtimes. Learn more in the docs here.\n\nCurious why we moved away from the Rust engine? Take a look at why we transitioned from Rust binary engines to an all-TypeScript approach for a faster, lighter Prisma ORM in this blog post.\n\nThe Prisma Client API reference documentation is based on the following schema:\n\nmodel User {\n\n  id           Int              @id @default(autoincrement())\n\n  name         String?\n\n  email        String           @unique\n\n  profileViews Int              @default(0)\n\n  role         Role             @default(USER)\n\n  coinflips    Boolean[]\n\n  posts        Post[]\n\n  city         String\n\n  country      String\n\n  profile      ExtendedProfile?\n\n  pets         Json\n\n}\n\n\n\nmodel ExtendedProfile {\n\n  id     Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\n\n  userId Int?    @unique\n\n  bio    String?\n\n  User   User?   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])\n\n}\n\n\n\nmodel Post {\n\n  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\n\n  title     String\n\n  published Boolean @default(true)\n\n  author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])\n\n  authorId  Int\n\n  comments  Json\n\n  views     Int     @default(0)\n\n  likes     Int     @default(0)\n\n}\n\n\n\nenum Role {\n\n  USER\n\n  ADMIN\n\n}\n\n\nAll example generated types (such as UserSelect and UserWhereUniqueInput) are based on the User model.\n\nPrismaClient​\n\nThis section describes the PrismaClient constructor and its parameters.\n\nRemarks​\nParameters are validated at runtime.\ndatasources​\n\nProgrammatically overrides properties of the datasource block in the schema.prisma file - for example, as part of an integration test. See also: Data sources\n\nFrom version 5.2.0 and upwards, you can also use the datasourceUrl property to programmatically override the database connection string.\n\nProperties​\nExample property\tExample value\tDescription\ndb\t{ url: 'file:./dev_qa.db' }\tThe database connection URL.\nRemarks​\nYou must re-generate Prisma Client each time you add or rename a data source. Datasource names are included in the generated client.\nIf you named your datasource block something else in the schema, replace db with the name of your datasource block.\nExamples​\nProgrammatically override a datasource url​\nimport { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\n\n\n\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient({\n\n  datasources: {\n\n    db: {\n\n      url: 'file:./dev_qa.db',\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\n\nBased on the following datasource block:\n\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"sqlite\"\n\n  url      = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n\n}\n\ndatasourceUrl​\n\nProgrammatically overrides the datasource block in the schema.prisma file.\n\nProperty​\nOption\tExample value\tDescription\nDatabase connection string\t'file:./dev_qa.db'\tThe database connection URL.\nExamples​\nimport { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\n\n\n\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient({\n\n  datasourceUrl: 'postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb',\n\n});\n\nlog​\n\nDetermines the type and level of logging.

As a result, one or more of the upsert operations might throw a unique key constraint error. Your application code can catch this error and retry the operation. Learn more.\nFrom version 4.6.0, Prisma ORM hands over upsert queries to the database where possible. Learn more.\nExamples​\nUpdate (if exists) or create a new User record with an email of alice@prisma.io​\nconst user = await prisma.user.upsert({\n\n  where: { id: 1 },\n\n  update: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },\n\n  create: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },\n\n});\n\nUnique key constraint errors on upserts​\nProblem​\n\nIf multiple upsert operations happen at the same time and the record doesn't already exist, then one or more of the operations might return a unique key constraint error.\n\nCause​\n\nWhen Prisma Client does an upsert, it first checks whether that record already exists in the database. To make this check, Prisma Client performs a read operation with the where clause from the upsert operation. This has two possible outcomes, as follows:\n\nIf the record does not exist, then Prisma Client creates that record.\nIf the record exists, then Prisma Client updates it.\n\nWhen your application tries to perform two or more concurrent upsert operations, then a race condition might happen where two or more operations do not find the record and therefore try to create that record. In this situation, one of the operations successfully creates the new record but the other operations fail and return a unique key constraint error.\n\nSolution​\n\nHandle the P2002 error in your application code. When it occurs, retry the upsert operation to update the row.\n\nDatabase upserts​\n\nWhere possible, Prisma Client hands over an upsert query to the database. This is called a database upsert.\n\nDatabase upserts have the following advantages:\n\nThey are faster than upserts handled by Prisma Client\nUnique key constraint errors cannot happen\n\nPrisma Client uses a database upsert automatically when specific criteria are met. When these criteria are not met, Prisma Client handles the upsert.\n\nTo use a database upsert, Prisma Client sends the SQL construction INSERT ... ON CONFLICT SET .. WHERE to the database.\n\nDatabase upsert prerequisites​\n\nPrisma Client can use database upserts if your stack meets the following criteria:\n\nYou use Prisma ORM version 4.6.0 or later\nYour application uses a CockroachDB, PostgreSQL, or SQLite data source\nDatabase upsert query criteria​\n\nPrisma Client uses a database upsert for an upsert query when the query meets the following criteria:\n\nThere are no nested queries in the upsert's create and update options\nThe query does not include a selection that uses a nested read\nThe query modifies only one model\nThere is only one unique field in the upsert's where option\nThe unique field in the where option and the unique field in the create option have the same value\n\nIf your query does not meet these criteria, then Prisma Client handles the upsert itself.\n\nDatabase upsert examples​\n\nThe following examples use this schema:\n\nmodel User {\n\n  id           Int    @id\n\n  profileViews Int\n\n  userName     String @unique\n\n  email        String\n\n\n\n  @@unique([id, profileViews])\n\n}\n\n\nThe following upsert query meets all of the criteria, so Prisma Client uses a database upsert.\n\nprisma.user.upsert({\n\n  where: {\n\n    userName: 'Alice',\n\n  },\n\n  create: {\n\n    id: 1,\n\n    profileViews: 1,\n\n    userName: 'Alice',\n\n    email: 'alice@prisma.io',\n\n  },\n\n  update: {\n\n    email: 'updated@example.com',\n\n  },\n\n});\n\n\nIn this situation, Prisma uses the following SQL query:\n\nINSERT INTO \"public\".\"User\" (\"id\",\"profileViews\",\"userName\",\"email\") VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4)\n\nON CONFLICT (\"userName\") DO UPDATE\n\nSET \"email\" = $5 WHERE (\"public\".\"User\".\"userName\" = $6 AND 1=1) RETURNING \"public\".\"User\".\"id\", \"public\".\"User\".\"profileViews\", \"public\".\"User\".\"userName\", \"public\".\"User\".\"email\"\n\n\nThe following query has multiple unique values in the where clause, so Prisma Client does not use a database upsert:\n\nprisma.User.upsert({\n\n  where: {\n\n    userName: 'Alice',\n\n    profileViews: 1,\n\n    id: 1,\n\n  },\n\n  create: {\n\n    id: 1,\n\n    profileViews: 1,\n\n    userName: 'Alice',\n\n    email: 'alice@prisma.io',\n\n  },\n\n  update: {\n\n    email: 'updated@example.com',\n\n  },\n\n});\n\n\nIn the following query, the values for userName in the where and create options are different, so Prisma Client does not use a database upsert.\n\nprisma.User.upsert({\n\n  where: {\n\n    userName: 'Alice',\n\n  },\n\n  create: {\n\n    id: 1,\n\n    profileViews: 1,\n\n    userName: 'AliceS',\n\n    email: 'alice@prisma.io',\n\n  },\n\n  update: {\n\n    email: 'updated@example.com',\n\n  },\n\n});\n\n\nIn the following query, the selection on the title field in posts is a nested read, so Prisma Client does not use a database upsert.\n\nprisma.user.upsert({\n\n  select: {\n\n    email: true,\n\n    id: true,\n\n    posts: {\n\n      select: {\n\n        title: true,\n\n      },\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n  where: {\n\n    userName: 'Alice',\n\n  },\n\n\n\n  create: {\n\n    id: 1,\n\n    profileViews: 1,\n\n    userName: 'Alice',\n\n    email: 'alice@prisma.io',\n\n  },\n\n  update: {\n\n    email: 'updated@example.com',\n\n  },\n\n});\n\ndelete()​\n\ndelete deletes an existing database record. You can delete a record:\n\nBy ID\nBy a unique attribute\n\nTo delete records that match a certain criteria, use deleteMany with a filter.\n\nOptions​\nName\tType\tRequired\tDescription\nwhere\tUserWhereUniqueInput\tYes\tWraps all fields of a model so that a record can be selected (learn more).\nBefore version 4.5.0, this type only wraps unique fields of a model.\nselect\tXOR<UserSelect, null>\tNo\tSpecifies which properties to include on the returned object.\ninclude\tXOR<UserInclude, null>\tNo\tSpecifies which relations should be eagerly loaded on the returned object.\nomit\tXOR<UserOmit, null>\tNo\tSpecifies which properties to exclude on the returned object.

It has two possible values:\n\njoin (default): Uses a database-level LATERAL JOIN (PostgreSQL) or correlated subqueries (MySQL) and fetches all data with a single query to the database.\nquery: Sends multiple queries to the database (one per table) and joins them on the application level.\n\nNote: Once relationLoadStrategy moves from Preview into General Availability, join will universally become the default for all relation queries.\n\nYou can learn more about join strategies here.\n\nBecause the relationLoadStrategy option is currently in Preview, you need to enable it via the relationJoins preview feature flag in your Prisma schema file:\n\ngenerator client {\n\n  provider        = \"prisma-client-js\"\n\n  previewFeatures = [\"relationJoins\"]\n\n}\n\n\nAfter adding this flag, you need to run prisma generate again to re-generate Prisma Client. The relationJoins feature is currently available on PostgreSQL, CockroachDB and MySQL.\n\nRemarks​\nIn most situations, the default join strategy will be more effective. Use query if you want to save resources on your database server or if you profiling shows that the application-level join is more performant.\nYou can only specify the relationLoadStrategy on the top-level in your query. The top-level choice will affect all nested sub-queries.\nExamples​\nLoad the posts relation via a database-level JOIN when using include​\nconst users = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  relationLoadStrategy: 'join',\n\n  include: {\n\n    posts: true,\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nLoad the posts relation via a database-level JOIN when using select​\nconst users = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  relationLoadStrategy: 'join',\n\n  select: {\n\n    posts: true,\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nwhere​\n\nwhere defines one or more filters, and can be used to filter on record properties (like a user's email address) or related record properties (like a user's top 10 most recent post titles).\n\nExamples​\nconst results = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  where: {\n\n    email: {\n\n      endsWith: 'prisma.io',\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nGenerated types for where​\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to use the validator with where:\n\nUserWhereInput\n\n// UserWhereInput\n\nconst whereNameIs = Prisma.validator<Prisma.UserWhereInput>()({\n\n  name: 'Rich',\n\n});\n\n\n\n// It can be combined with conditional operators too\n\nconst whereNameIs = Prisma.validator<Prisma.UserWhereInput>()({\n\n  name: 'Rich',\n\n  AND: [\n\n    {\n\n      email: {\n\n        contains: 'rich@boop.com',\n\n      },\n\n    },\n\n  ],\n\n});\n\n\nUserWhereUniqueInput This type works by exposing any unique fields on the model. A field assigned @id is considered unique, as is one assigned @unique.\n\nFrom version 4.5.0, this type exposes all fields on the model. This means that when you filter for a single record based on a unique field, you can check additional non-unique and unique fields at the same time. Learn more.\n\n// UserWhereUniqueInput\n\nconst whereEmailIsUnique = Prisma.validator<Prisma.UserWhereUniqueInput>()({\n\n  email: 'rich@boop.com',\n\n})\n\n\nPostScalarWhereInput\n\nconst whereScalarTitleIs = Prisma.validator<Prisma.PostScalarWhereInput>()({\n\n  title: 'boop',\n\n});\n\n\nPostUpdateWithWhereUniqueWithoutAuthorInput - This type accepts a unique where field (an @id or another assigned @unique) and updates any field on the Post model except the Author. The Author is the scalar field on the Post model.\n\nconst updatePostByIdWithoutAuthor =\n\n  Prisma.validator<Prisma.PostUpdateWithWhereUniqueWithoutAuthorInput>()({\n\n    where: {\n\n      id: 1,\n\n    },\n\n    data: {\n\n      content: 'This is some updated content',\n\n      published: true,\n\n      title: 'This is a new title',\n\n    },\n\n  });\n\n\nPostUpsertWithWhereUniqueWithoutAuthorInput - This type will update the Post records title field where the id matches, if it doesn't exist it will create it instead.\n\nconst updatePostTitleOrCreateIfNotExist =\n\n  Prisma.validator<Prisma.PostUpsertWithWhereUniqueWithoutAuthorInput>()({\n\n    where: {\n\n      id: 1,\n\n    },\n\n    update: {\n\n      title: 'This is a new title',\n\n    },\n\n    create: {\n\n      id: 1,\n\n      title: 'If the title doesnt exist, then create one with this text',\n\n    },\n\n  });\n\n\nPostUpdateManyWithWhereWithoutAuthorInput - This type will update all Post records where published is set to false.\n\nconst publishAllPosts = Prisma.validator<Prisma.PostUpdateManyWithWhereWithoutAuthorInput>()({\n\n  where: {\n\n    published: {\n\n      equals: false,\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n  data: {\n\n    published: true,\n\n  },\n\n});\n\norderBy​\n\nSorts a list of records. See also: Sorting\n\nRemarks​\n\nIn 2.16.0\n and later, you can order by relation fields - for example, order posts by the author's name.\n\nIn 3.5.0\n and later, in PostgreSQL you can order by relevance. For details, see Sort by relevance.\n\nIn 4.1.0\n and later, you can sort null records first or last. For details, see Sort with nulls first or last.\n\nInputs for sort argument​\nName\tDescription\nasc\tSort ascending (A → Z)\ndesc\tSort descending (Z → A)\nInputs for nulls argument​\n\nNote:\n\nThis argument is optional.\nIt is for use on optional scalar fields only. If you try to sort by nulls on a required or relation field, Prisma Client throws a P2009 error.\nIt is available in version 4.1.0 and later, as a preview feature. See sort with nulls first or last for details of how to enable the feature.\nName\tDescription\nfirst\tSort with null values first.\nlast\tSort with null values last.\nExamples​\nSort User by email field​\n\nThe following example returns all User records sorted by email ascending:\n\nconst users = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  orderBy: {\n\n    email: 'asc',\n\n  },\n\n});\n\n\nThe following example returns all User records sorted by email descending:\n\nconst users = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  orderBy: {\n\n    email: 'desc',\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nSort Post by the related User record's name​\n\nThe following query orders posts by user name:\n\nconst posts = await prisma.post.findMany({\n\n  orderBy: {\n\n    author: {\n\n      name: 'asc',\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nSort Post by the related User record's name, with null records first​\n\nThe following query orders posts by user name, with null records first:\n\nconst posts = await prisma.post.findMany({\n\n  orderBy: {\n\n    author: {\n\n      name: { sort: 'asc', nulls: 'first' },\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nSort Post by relevance of the title​\nINFO\n\nFor PostgreSQL, this feature is still in Preview. Enable the fullTextSearchPostgres feature flag in order to use it.\n\nThe following query orders posts by relevance of the search term 'database' to the title:\n\nconst posts = await prisma.post.findMany({\n\n  orderBy: {\n\n    _relevance: {\n\n      fields: ['title'],\n\n      search: 'database',\n\n      sort: 'asc'\n\n    },\n\n})\n\nSort User by the posts count​\n\nThe following query orders users by post count:\n\nconst getActiveusers = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  orderBy: {\n\n    posts: {\n\n      count: 'desc',\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nSort User by multiple fields - email and role​\n\nThe following example sorts users by two fields - first email, then role:\n\nconst users = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  select: {\n\n    email: true,\n\n    role: true,\n\n  },\n\n  orderBy: [\n\n    {\n\n      email: 'desc',\n\n    },\n\n    {\n\n      role: 'desc',\n\n    },\n\n  ],\n\n});\n\nShow CLI results\n\nThe order of sorting parameters matters - the following query sorts by role, then email. Note the difference in the results:\n\nconst users = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  select: {\n\n    email: true,\n\n    role: true,\n\n  },\n\n  orderBy: [\n\n    {\n\n      role: 'desc',\n\n    },\n\n    {\n\n      email: 'desc',\n\n    },\n\n  ],\n\n});\n\nShow CLI results\nSort User by email, select name and email​\n\nThe following example returns all the name and email fields of all User records, sorted by email:\n\nconst users3 = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  orderBy: {\n\n    email: 'asc',\n\n  },\n\n  select: {\n\n    name: true,\n\n    email: true,\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nShow CLI results\nSort User records by email and sort nested Post records by title​\n\nThe following example:\n\nReturns all User records sorted by email\nFor each User record, returns the title field of all nested Post records sorted by title\nconst usersWithPosts = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  orderBy: {\n\n    email: 'asc',\n\n  },\n\n  include: {\n\n    posts: {\n\n      select: {\n\n        title: true,\n\n      },\n\n      orderBy: {\n\n        title: 'asc',\n\n      },\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nShow CLI results\nSort one user's nested list of Post records​\n\nThe following example retrieves a single User record by ID, as well as a list of nested Post records sorted by title:\n\nconst userWithPosts = await prisma.user.findUnique({\n\n  where: {\n\n    id: 1,\n\n  },\n\n  include: {\n\n    posts: {\n\n      orderBy: {\n\n        title: 'desc',\n\n      },\n\n      select: {\n\n        title: true,\n\n        published: true,\n\n      },\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nShow CLI results\nSort by enum​\n\nThe following sorts all User records by role (an enum):\n\nconst sort = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  orderBy: {\n\n    role: 'desc',\n\n  },\n\n  select: {\n\n    email: true,\n\n    role: true,\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nShow CLI results\nGenerated types for orderBy​\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to use the validator with orderBy:\n\nUserOrderByInput\nconst orderEmailsByDescending = Prisma.validator<Prisma.UserOrderByInput>()({\n\n  email: 'desc',\n\n});\n\ndistinct​\n\nDeduplicate a list of records from findMany or findFirst. See also: Aggregation, grouping, and summarizing\n\nExamples​\nSelect distinct on a single field​\n\nThe following example returns all distinct city fields, and selects only the city and country fields:\n\nconst distinctCities = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  select: {\n\n    city: true,\n\n    country: true,\n\n  },\n\n  distinct: ['city'],\n\n});\n\nShow CLI results\n[\n\n  { city: 'Paris', country: 'France' },\n\n  { city: 'Lyon', country: 'France' },\n\n];\n\nSelect distinct on multiple fields​\n\nThe following example returns all distinct city and country field combinations, and selects only the city and country fields:\n\nconst distinctCitiesAndCountries = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  select: {\n\n    city: true,\n\n    country: true,\n\n  },\n\n  distinct: ['city', 'country'],\n\n});\n\nShow CLI results\n[\n\n  { city: 'Paris', country: 'France' },\n\n  { city: 'Paris', country: 'Denmark' },\n\n  { city: 'Lyon', country: 'France' },\n\n];\n\n\nNote that there is now a \"Paris, Denmark\" in addition to \"Paris, France\":\n\nSelect distinct in combination with a filter​\n\nThe following example returns all distinct city and country field combinations where the user's email contains \"prisma.io\", and selects only the city and country fields:\n\nconst distinctCitiesAndCountries = await prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  where: {\n\n    email: {\n\n      contains: 'prisma.io',\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n  select: {\n\n    city: true,\n\n    country: true,\n\n  },\n\n  distinct: ['city', 'country'],\n\n});\n\nShow CLI results\nnativeDistinct​\n\nEnabling nativeDistinct in your Prisma schema pushes the distinct operation to the database layer (where supported). This can significantly improve performance. However, note that:\n\nSome databases may not fully support DISTINCT on certain field combinations.\nBehavior can differ among providers.\n\nTo enable nativeDistinct:\n\ngenerator client {\n\n  provider        = \"prisma-client-js\"\n\n  previewFeatures = [\"nativeDistinct\"]\n\n}\n\n\nSee Preview Features for more details.\n\nNested queries​\ncreate​\n\nA nested create query adds a new related record or set of records to a parent record. See: Working with relations\n\nRemarks​\ncreate is available as a nested query when you create() (prisma.user.create(...)) a new parent record or update() (prisma.user.update(...)) an existing parent record.\nYou can use a nested create or a nested createMany to create multiple related records. If you require the skipDuplicates query option you should use createMany.\nExamples​\nCreate a new User record with a new Profile record​\nconst user = await prisma.user.create({\n\n  data: {\n\n    email: 'alice@prisma.io',\n\n    profile: {\n\n      create: { bio: 'Hello World' },\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nCreate a new Profile record with a new User record​\nconst user = await prisma.profile.create({\n\n  data: {\n\n    bio: 'Hello World',\n\n    user: {\n\n      create: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n})\n\nCreate a new User record with a new Post record​\nconst user = await prisma.user.create({\n\n  data: {\n\n    email: 'alice@prisma.io',\n\n    posts: {\n\n      create: { title: 'Hello World' },\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nCreate a new User record with two new Post records​\n\nBecause it's a one-to-many relation, you can also create multiple Post records at once by passing an array to create:\n\nconst user = await prisma.user.create({\n\n  data: {\n\n    email: 'alice@prisma.io',\n\n    posts: {\n\n      create: [\n\n        {\n\n          title: 'This is my first post',\n\n        },\n\n        {\n\n          title: 'Here comes a second post',\n\n        },\n\n      ],\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\n\nNote: You can also use a nested createMany to achieve the same result.\n\nUpdate an existing User record by creating a new Profile record​\nconst user = await prisma.user.update({\n\n  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },\n\n  data: {\n\n    profile: {\n\n      create: { bio: 'Hello World' },\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nUpdate an existing User record by creating a new Post record​\nconst user = await prisma.user.update({\n\n  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },\n\n  data: {\n\n    posts: {\n\n      create: { title: 'Hello World' },\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n})\n\ncreateMany​\n\nA nested createMany query adds a new set of records to a parent record. See: Working with relations\n\nRemarks​\ncreateMany is available as a nested query when you create() (prisma.user.create(...)) a new parent record or update() (prisma.user.update(...)) an existing parent record.\nAvailable in the context of a one-to-many relation — for example, you can prisma.user.create(...) a user and use a nested createMany to create multiple posts (posts have one user).\nNot available in the context of a many-to-many relation — for example, you cannot prisma.post.create(...) a post and use a nested createMany to create categories (many posts have many categories).\nYou cannot nest an additional create or createMany.\nAllows setting foreign keys directly — for example, setting the categoryId on a post.\nAs of Prisma ORM version 5.12.0, nested createMany is supported by SQLite.\nYou can use a nested create or a nested createMany to create multiple related records - if you do not need the skipDuplicates query option, you should probably use create.\nOptions​\nName\tType\tRequired\tDescription\ndata\tEnumerable<UserCreateManyInput>\tYes\tWraps all the model fields in a type so that they can be provided when creating new records. Fields that are marked as optional or have default values in the datamodel are optional.\nskipDuplicates?\tboolean\tNo\tDo not insert records with unique fields or ID fields that already exist. Only supported by databases that support \nON CONFLICT DO NOTHING\n. This excludes MongoDB and SQLServer\nExamples​\nUpdate a User and multiple new related Post records​\nconst user = await prisma.user.update({\n\n  where: {\n\n    id: 9,\n\n  },\n\n  data: {\n\n    name: 'Elliott',\n\n    posts: {\n\n      createMany: {\n\n        data: [{ title: 'My first post' }, { title: 'My second post' }],\n\n      },\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nset​\n\nset overwrites the value of a relation - for example, replacing a list of Post records with a different list. See: Working with relations\n\nExamples​\nUpdate an existing User record by disconnecting any previous Post records and connecting two other existing ones​\nconst user = await prisma.user.update({\n\n  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },\n\n  data: {\n\n    posts: {\n\n      set: [{ id: 32 }, { id: 42 }],\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nconnect​\n\nA nested connect query connects a record to an existing related record by specifying an ID or unique identifier. See: Working with relations\n\nRemarks​\n\nconnect is available as a nested query when you create a new parent record or update an existing parent record.\n\nIf the related record does not exist, Prisma Client throws an exception:\n\nThe required connected records were not found. Expected 1 records to be connected, found 0.\n\n\nWhen using set and connect together, the order in which they are applied significantly impacts the result. If set is used before connect, the connected records will only reflect the final state established by the connect operation, as set clears all existing connections before connect establishes new ones. Conversely, if connect is applied before set, the set operation will override the connect action by clearing all connected records and replacing them with its own specified state.\n\nExamples​\nCreate a new Profile record and connect it to an existing User record via unique field​\nconst user = await prisma.profile.create({\n\n  data: {\n\n    bio: 'Hello World',\n\n    user: {\n\n      connect: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nCreate a new Profile record and connect it to an existing User record via an ID field​\nconst user = await prisma.profile.create({\n\n  data: {\n\n    bio: 'Hello World',\n\n    user: {\n\n      connect: { id: 42 }, // sets userId of Profile record\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\n\nIn 2.11.0\n and later, you can set the foreign key directly:\n\nconst user = await prisma.profile.create({\n\n  data: {\n\n    bio: 'Hello World',\n\n    userId: 42,\n\n  },\n\n});\n\n\nHowever, you can't use both the direct approach and the connect approach in the same query. See this issue comment\n for details.\n\nCreate a new Post record and connect it to an existing User record​\nconst user = await prisma.post.create({\n\n  data: {\n\n    title: 'Hello World',\n\n    author: {\n\n      connect: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nUpdate an existing User record by connecting it to an existing Profile record​\nconst user = await prisma.user.update({\n\n  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },\n\n  data: {\n\n    profile: {\n\n      connect: { id: 24 },\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nUpdate an existing User record by connecting it to two existing Post records​\nconst user = await prisma.user.update({\n\n  where: { email: 'alice@prisma.io' },\n\n  data: {\n\n    posts: {\n\n      connect: [{ id: 24 }, { id: 42 }],\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nconnectOrCreate​\n\nconnectOrCreate either connects a record to an existing related record by ID or unique identifier or creates a new related record if the record does not exist. See: Working with relations\n\nRemarks​\n\nMultiple connectOrCreate queries that run as concurrent transactions can result in a race condition.

Learn more: Metrics.\n\nPrisma Client metrics has the following methods:\n\n$metrics.json(): Retrieves Prisma Client metrics in JSON format.\n$metrics.prometheus(): Retrieves Prisma Client metrics in Prometheus format.\n$extends​\n\nWith $extends, you can create and use Prisma Client extensions to add functionality to Prisma Client in the following ways:\n\nmodel: add custom methods to your models\nclient: add custom methods to your client\nquery: create custom Prisma Client queries\nresult: add custom fields to your query results\n\nLearn more: Prisma Client extensions.\n\nUtility types​\n\nUtility types are helper functions and types that live on the Prisma namespace. They are useful for keeping your application type safe.\n\nPrisma.validator​\n\nThe validator helps you create re-usable query parameters based on your schema models while making sure that the objects you create are valid. See also: Using Prisma.validator\n\nThere are two ways you can use the validator:\n\nUsing generated Prisma Client types​\n\nUsing types provides a type-level approach to validate data:\n\nPrisma.validator<GeneratedType>({ args });\n\nUsing a \"selector\"​\n\nWhen using the selector pattern, you use an existing Prisma Client instance to create a validator. This pattern allows you to select the model, operation, and query option to validate against.\n\nYou can also use an instance of Prisma Client that has been extended using a Prisma Client extension.\n\nPrisma.validator(PrismaClientInstance, '<model>', '<operation>', '<query option>')({ args });\n\nExamples​\n\nThe following example shows how you can extract and validate the input for the create operation you can reuse within your app:\n\nimport { Prisma } from '@prisma/client';\n\n\n\nconst validateUserAndPostInput = (name, email, postTitle) => {\n\n  return Prisma.validator<Prisma.UserCreateInput>()({\n\n    name,\n\n    email,\n\n    posts: {\n\n      create: {\n\n        title: postTitle,\n\n      },\n\n    },\n\n  });\n\n};\n\n\nHere is an alternative syntax for the same operation:\n\nimport { Prisma } from '@prisma/client';\n\nimport prisma from './prisma';\n\n\n\nconst validateUserAndPostInput = (name, email, postTitle) => {\n\n  return Prisma.validator(\n\n    prisma,\n\n    'user',\n\n    'create',\n\n    'data'\n\n  )({\n\n    name,\n\n    email,\n\n    posts: {\n\n      create: {\n\n        title: postTitle,\n\n      },\n\n    },\n\n  });\n\n};\n\nCompare columns in the same table​\n\nYou can compare columns in the same table directly, for non-unique filters.\n\nThis feature was moved to general availability in version 5.0.0 and was available via the fieldReference Preview feature from Prisma ORM versions 4.3.0 to 4.16.2.\n\nINFO\n\nIn the following situations, you must use raw queries to compare columns in the same table:\n\nIf you use a version earlier than 4.3.0\nIf you want to use a unique filter, such as findUnique or findUniqueOrThrow\nIf you want to compare a field with a unique constraint\nIf you want to use one of the following operators to compare a JSON field in MySQL or MariaDB with another field: gt, gte, lt, or lte. Note that you can use these operators to compare the JSON field with a scalar value. This limitation applies only if you try to compare a JSON field with another field.\n\nTo compare columns in the same table, use the <model>.fields property. In the following example, the query returns all records where the value in the prisma.product.quantity field is less than or equal to the value in the prisma.product.warnQuantity field.\n\nprisma.product.findMany({\n\n  where: { quantity: { lte: prisma.product.fields.warnQuantity } },\n\n});\n\nINFO\n\nfields is a special property of every model. It contains the list of fields for that model.\n\nConsiderations​\nFields must be of the same type​\n\nYou can only make comparisons on fields of the same type. For example, the following causes an error:\n\nawait prisma.order.findMany({\n\n  where: {\n\n    id: { equals: prisma.order.fields.due },\n\n    // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n    // Type error: id is a string, while amountDue is an integer\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nFields must be in the same model​\n\nYou can only make comparisons with the fields property on fields in the same model. The following example does not work:\n\nawait prisma.order.findMany({\n\n  where: {\n\n    id: { equals: prisma.user.fields.name },\n\n    // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n    // Type error: name is a field on the User model, not Order\n\n  },\n\n});\n\n\nHowever, you can compare fields in separate models with standard queries.\n\nIn groupBy model queries, put your referenced fields in the by argument​\n\nIf you use the groupBy model query with the having option, then you must put your referenced fields in the by argument.\n\nThe following example works:\n\nprisma.user.groupBy({\n\n  by: ['id', 'name'],\n\n  having: { id: { equals: prisma.user.fields.name } },\n\n});\n\n\nThe following example does not work, because name is not in the by argument:\n\nprisma.user.groupBy({\n\n  by: ['id'],\n\n  having: { id: { equals: prisma.user.fields.name } },\n\n  // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n  // name is not in the 'by' argument\n\n});\n\nSearch for fields in scalar lists​\n\nIf your data source supports scalar lists (for example in PostgreSQL), then you can search for all records where a specific field is in a list of fields. To do so, reference the scalar list with the in and notIn filters. For example:\n\nawait prisma.user.findMany({\n\n  where: {\n\n    // find all users where 'name' is in a list of tags\n\n    name: { in: prisma.user.fields.tags },\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nFilter on non-unique fields with UserWhereUniqueInput​\n\nFrom version 5.0.0, the generated type UserWhereUniqueInput on where exposes all fields on the model, not just unique fields. This was available under the extendedWhereUnique Preview flag between versions 4.5.0 to 4.16.2\n\nYou must specify at least one unique field in your where statement outside of boolean operators, and you can specify any number of additional unique and non-unique fields. You can use this to add filters to any operation that returns a single record. For example, you can use this feature for the following:\n\nOptimistic concurrency control on updates\nPermission checks\nSoft deletes\n\nFrom version 4.6.0, you can use this feature to filter on optional one-to-one nested reads.\n\nOptimistic concurrency control on updates​\n\nYou can filter on non-unique fields to perform optimistic concurrency control on update operations.\n\nTo perform optimistic concurrency control, we recommend that you use a version field to check whether the data in a record or related record has changed while your code executes. Before version 4.5.0, you could not evaluate the version field in an update operation, because the field is non-unique. From version 4.5.0, you can evaluate the version field.\n\nIn the following example, updateOne and updateTwo first read the same record and then attempt to update it. The database only executes these updates if the value in version is the same as the value when it did the initial read. When the database executes the first of these updates (which might be updateOne or updateTwo, depending on timing), it increments the value in version. This means that the database does not execute the second update because the value in version has changed.\n\nmodel User {\n\n  id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())\n\n  email   String @unique\n\n  city    String\n\n  version Int\n\n}\n\nfunction updateOne() {\n\n  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ id: 1 });\n\n\n\n  await prisma.user.update({\n\n    where: { id: user.id, version: user.version },\n\n    data: { city: 'Berlin', version: { increment: 1 } },\n\n  });\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction updateTwo() {\n\n  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ id: 1 });\n\n\n\n  await prisma.user.update({\n\n    where: { id: user.id, version: user.version },\n\n    data: { city: 'New York', version: { increment: 1 } },\n\n  });\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction main() {\n\n  await Promise.allSettled([updateOne(), updateTwo()]);\n\n}\n\nPermission checks​\n\nYou can filter on non-unique fields to check permissions during an update.\n\nIn the following example, a user wants to update a post title. The where statement checks the value in authorId to confirm that the user is the author of the post. The application only updates the post title if the user is the post author.\n\nawait prisma.post.update({\n\n  where: { id: 1, authorId: 1 },\n\n  data: { title: 'Updated post title' },\n\n});\n\nSoft deletes​\n\nYou can filter on non-unique fields to handle soft deletes.\n\nIn the following example, we do not want to return a post if it is soft-deleted. The operation only returns the post if the value in isDeleted is false.\n\nprisma.Post.findUnique({ where: { id: postId, isDeleted: false } });\n\nUserWhereUniqueInput considerations​\nBoolean operators with UserWhereUniqueInput​\n\nWith UserWhereUniqueInput, you must specify at least one unique field outside of the boolean operators AND, OR, NOT. You can still use these boolean operators in conjunction with any other unique fields or non-unique fields in your filter.\n\nIn the following example, we test id, a unique field, in conjunction with email. This is valid.\n\nawait prisma.user.update({\n\n  where: { id: 1, OR: [{ email: \"bob@prisma.io\" }, { email: \"alice@prisma.io\" }] },\n\n        // ^^^ Valid: the expression specifies a unique field (`id`) outside of any boolean operators\n\n  data: { ... }\n\n})\n\n\n\n// SQL equivalent:\n\n// WHERE id = 1 AND (email = \"bob@prisma.io\" OR email = \"alice@prisma.io\")\n\n\nThe following example is not valid, because there is no unique field outside of any boolean operators:\n\nawait prisma.user.update({\n\n  where: { OR: [{ email: \"bob@prisma.io\" }, { email: \"alice@prisma.io\" }] },\n\n        // ^^^ Invalid: the expressions does not contain a unique field outside of boolean operators\n\n  data: { ... }\n\n})\n\nOne-to-one relations​\n\nFrom version 4.5.0, you can filter on non-unique fields in the following operations on one-to-one relations:\n\nNested update\nNested upsert\nNested disconnect\nNested delete\n\nPrisma Client automatically uses a unique filter to select the appropriate related record. As a result, you do not need to specify a unique filter in your where statement with a WhereUniqueInput generated type. Instead, the where statement has a WhereInput generated type. You can use this to filter without the restrictions of WhereUniqueInput.\n\nNested update example​\nawait prisma.user.update({\n\n  where: { id: 1, },\n\n  data: {\n\n    to_one: {\n\n      // Before Prisma version 4.5.0\n\n      update: { field: \"updated\" }\n\n      // From Prisma version 4.5.0, you can also do the following:\n\n      update: { where: { /*WhereInput*/ }, data: { field: \"updated\" } } }\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n})\n\nNested upsert example​\nawait prisma.user.update({\n\n  where: { id: 1, },\n\n  data: {\n\n    to_one: {\n\n      upsert: {\n\n        where: { /* WhereInput */ } // new argument from Prisma 4.5.0\n\n        create: { /* CreateInput */ },\n\n        update: { /* CreateInput */ },\n\n      }\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n})\n\nNested disconnect example​\nawait prisma.user.update({\n\n  where: { id: 1, },\n\n  data: {\n\n    to_one: {\n\n      // Before Prisma version 4.5.0\n\n      disconnect: true\n\n      // From Prisma version 4.5.0, you can also do the following:\n\n      disconnect: { /* WhereInput */ }\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n})\n\nNested delete example​\nawait prisma.user.update({\n\n  where: { id: 1, },\n\n  data: {\n\n    to_one: {\n\n      // Before Prisma version 4.5.0\n\n      delete: true\n\n      // From Prisma version 4.5.0, you can also do the following:\n\n      delete: { /* WhereInput */ }\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n})\n\nPrismaPromise behavior​\n\nAll Prisma Client queries return an instance of PrismaPromise. This is a \"thenable\"\n, meaning a PrismaPromise only executes when you call await or .then() or .catch(). This behavior is different from a regular JavaScript \nPromise\n, which starts executing immediately.\n\nFor example:\n\nconst findPostOperation = prisma.post.findMany({}); // Query not yet executed\n\n\n\nfindPostOperation.then(); // Prisma Client now executes the query\n\n// or\n\nawait findPostOperation; // Prisma Client now executes the query\n\n\nWhen using the $transaction API, this behavior makes it possible for Prisma Client to pass all the queries on to the query engine as a single transaction."

If you do not supply a time yourself, Prisma Client will automatically set the value for fields with this attribute.\n\nRemarks​\nCompatible with DateTime fields\nImplemented at Prisma ORM level\nWARNING\n\nIn versions before 4.4.0\n, if you're also using now(), the time might differ from the @updatedAt values if your database and app have different time zones. This happens because @updatedAt operates at the Prisma ORM level, while now() operates at the database level.\n\nNOTE\n\nIf you pass an empty update clause, the @updatedAt value will remain unchanged. For example:\n\nawait prisma.user.update({\n\n  where: {\n\n    id: 1,\n\n  },\n\n  data: {}, //<- Empty update clause\n\n});\n\nArguments​\n\nN/A\n\nSignature​\n@updatedAt\n\nExamples​\nRelational databases\nMongoDB\nmodel Post {\n\n  id        String   @id\n\n  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt\n\n}\n\n@ignore​\n\nAdd @ignore to a field that you want to exclude from Prisma Client (for example, a field that you do not want Prisma Client users to update). Ignored fields are excluded from the generated Prisma Client. The model's create method is disabled when doing this for required fields with no @default (because the database cannot create an entry without that data).\n\nRemarks​\nIn 2.17.0\n and later, Prisma ORM automatically adds @ignore to fields that refer to invalid models when you introspect.\nExamples​\n\nThe following example demonstrates manually adding @ignore to exclude the email field from Prisma Client:\n\nschema.prisma\nmodel User {\n\n  id    Int    @id\n\n  name  String\n\n  email String @ignore // this field will be excluded\n\n}\n\n@@ignore​\n\nAdd @@ignore to a model that you want to exclude from Prisma Client (for example, a model that you do not want Prisma users to update). Ignored models are excluded from the generated Prisma Client.\n\nRemarks​\nIn 2.17.0\n and later, Prisma ORM adds @@ignore to an invalid model. (It also adds @ignore to relations pointing to such a model)\nExamples​\n\nIn the following example, the Post model is invalid because it does not have a unique identifier. Use @@ignore to exclude it from the generated Prisma Client API:\n\nschema.prisma\n/// The underlying table does not contain a valid unique identifier and can therefore currently not be handled by Prisma Client.\n\nmodel Post {\n\n  id       Int  @default(autoincrement()) // no unique identifier\n\n  author   User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])\n\n  authorId Int\n\n\n\n  @@ignore\n\n}\n\n\nIn the following example, the Post model is invalid because it does not have a unique identifier, and the posts relation field on User is invalid because it refers to the invalid Post model. Use @@ignore on the Post model and @ignore on the posts relation field in User to exclude both the model and the relation field from the generated Prisma Client API:\n\nschema.prisma\n/// The underlying table does not contain a valid unique identifier and can therefore currently not be handled by Prisma Client.\n\nmodel Post {\n\n  id       Int  @default(autoincrement()) // no unique identifier\n\n  author   User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])\n\n  authorId Int\n\n\n\n  @@ignore\n\n}\n\n\n\nmodel User {\n\n  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\n\n  name  String?\n\n  posts Post[]  @ignore\n\n}\n\n@@schema​\n\nAdd @@schema to a model to specify which schema in your database should contain the table associated with that model. Learn more about adding multiple schema's here.\n\nNOTE\n\nMultiple database schema support is only available with the PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, and SQL Server connectors.\n\nArguments​\nName\tType\tRequired\tDescription\tExample\nname\tString\tYes\tThe name of the database schema.\t\"base\", \"auth\"\n\nThe name of the name argument on the @@schema attribute can be omitted\n\n@@schema(name: \"auth\")\n\n@@schema(\"auth\")\n\nSignature​\n@@schema(_ name: String)\n\nExamples​\nMap the User model to a database schema named auth​\ngenerator client {\n\n  provider        = \"prisma-client-js\"\n\n}\n\n\n\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n\n  url      = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n\n  schemas  = [\"auth\"]\n\n}\n\n\n\nmodel User {\n\n  id   Int    @id @default(autoincrement())\n\n  name String\n\n\n\n  @@schema(\"auth\")\n\n}\n\nINFO\n\nFor more information about using the multiSchema feature, refer to this guide.\n\n@shardKey​\nNOTE\n\nThis features requires the shardKeys Preview feature flag on your generator:\n\ngenerator client {\n\n  provider = \"prisma-client-js\"\n\n  output = \"../generated/prisma\"\n\n  previewFeatures = [\"shardKeys\"]\n\n}\n\n\nThe @shardKey attribute is only compatible with PlanetScale\n databases.

You can still use cuid() when using introspection by manually changing your Prisma schema and generating Prisma Client, in that case the values will be generated by Prisma's query engine.\nSince the length of cuid() output is undefined per the cuid creator, a safe field size is 30 characters, in order to allow for enough characters for very large values. If you set the field size as less than 30, and then a larger value is generated by cuid(), you might see Prisma Client errors such as Error: The provided value for the column is too long for the column's type.\nFor MongoDB: cuid() does not generate a valid ObjectId. You can use @db.ObjectId syntax if you want to use ObjectId in the underlying database. However, you can still use cuid() if your _id field is not of type ObjectId.\nExamples​\nGenerate cuid() values as IDs​\nRelational databases\nMongoDB\nmodel User {\n\n  id   String @id @default(cuid())\n\n  name String\n\n}\n\nGenerate cuid(2) values as IDs based on the cuid2 spec​\nRelational databases\nMongoDB\nmodel User {\n\n  id   String @id @default(cuid(2))\n\n  name String\n\n}\n\nuuid()​\n\nGenerate a globally unique identifier based on the UUID\n spec. Prisma ORM supports versions 4 (default) and 7.\n\nRemarks​\nCompatible with String.\nImplemented by Prisma ORM and therefore not \"visible\" in the underlying database schema. You can still use uuid() when using introspection by manually changing your Prisma schema and generating Prisma Client, in that case the values will be generated by Prisma ORM's query engine.\nFor relational databases: If you do not want to use Prisma ORM's uuid() function, you can use the native database function with dbgenerated.\nFor MongoDB: uuid() does not generate a valid ObjectId. You can use @db.ObjectId syntax if you want to use ObjectId in the underlying database. However, you can still use uuid() if your _id field is not of type ObjectId.\nExamples​\nGenerate uuid() values as IDs using UUID v4​\nRelational databases\nMongoDB\nmodel User {\n\n  id   String @id @default(uuid())\n\n  name String\n\n}\n\nGenerate uuid(7) values as IDs using UUID v7​\nRelational databases\nMongoDB\nmodel User {\n\n  id   String @id @default(uuid(7))\n\n  name String\n\n}\n\nulid()​\n\nGenerate a universally unique lexicographically sortable identifier based on the ULID\n spec.\n\nRemarks​\nulid() will produce 128-bit random identifier represented as a 26-character long alphanumeric string, e.g.: 01ARZ3NDEKTSV4RRFFQ69G5FAV\nExamples​\nGenerate ulid() values as IDs​\nRelational databases\nMongoDB\nmodel User {\n\n  id   String @id @default(ulid())\n\n  name String\n\n}\n\nnanoid()​\n\nGenerated values based on the Nano ID\n spec. nanoid() accepts an integer value between 2 and 255 that specifies the length of the generate ID value, e.g. nanoid(16) will generated ID with 16 characters. If you don't provide a value to the nanoid() function, the default value is 21.\n\nINFO\n\nNano ID is quite comparable to UUID v4 (random-based). It has a similar number of random bits in the ID (126 in Nano ID and 122 in UUID), so it has a similar collision probability:\n\nFor there to be a one in a billion chance of duplication, 103 trillion version 4 IDs must be generated.\n\nThere are two main differences between Nano ID and UUID v4:\n\nNano ID uses a bigger alphabet, so a similar number of random bits are packed in just 21 symbols instead of 36.\nNano ID code is 4 times smaller than uuid/v4 package: 130 bytes instead of 423.\nRemarks​\nCompatible with String.\nImplemented by Prisma ORM and therefore not \"visible\" in the underlying database schema.

This does three things:\n\nSearches the current directory and parent directories to find the applicable npm project. It will create a package.json file in the current directory if it cannot find one.\nInstalls the @prisma/client into the npm project if it is not already present.\nInspects the current directory to find a Prisma Schema to process. It will then generate a customized Prisma Client\n for your project.\nPrerequisites​\n\nTo use the generate command, you must add a generator definition in your schema.prisma file. The prisma-client-js generator, used to generate Prisma Client, can be added by including the following in your schema.prisma file:\n\ngenerator client {\n\n  provider = \"prisma-client-js\"\n\n}\n\nOptions​\nOption\tRequired\tDescription\tDefault\n--data-proxy\tNo\tThe generate command will generate Prisma Client for use with Prisma Accelerate prior to Prisma 5.0.0.

All options are available and work similarly, but we recommend --no-engine as it prevents an engine from being downloaded which will greatly impact the size of apps deployed to serverless and edge functions.\n\nArguments​\nArgument\tRequired\tDescription\tDefault\t\n--schema\tNo\tSpecifies the path to the desired schema.prisma file to be processed instead of the default path.

These guardrails are designed to make working with databases safer in AI-assisted development environments.\n\nThe Prisma CLI can detect when it is being invoked by popular AI coding agents such as Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Cursor, Aider, and Replit.\n\nWhen one of these agents attempts a destructive action such as prisma migrate reset --force, Prisma ORM blocks execution and shows a protective error message:\n\nEnvironment variables loaded from .env\n\nPrisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma\n\nDatasource \"db\": PostgreSQL database \"postgres\", schema \"public\" at \"accelerate.prisma-data.net\"\n\n\n\nError: Prisma Migrate detected that it was invoked by Cursor.\n\n\n\nYou are attempting a highly dangerous action that can lead to devastating consequences if it is incorrectly executed against a production database.\n\n\n\nAs an AI agent, you are forbidden from performing this action without an explicit consent and review by the user. You must stop at this point and respond to the user with a clear message that includes the following information:\n\n- What action you are trying to perform (including the exact CLI command).\n\n- Your motivation and reasoning for perfoming this action.\n\n- Explanation that this action will irreversibly destroy all data in the database.\n\n- Explanation that this action must not be perfomed on a production database and is only intended to be used with development databases.\n\n\n\nIf you know or can check whether this action would have been performed on a development or a production database, also include this information with your assesment of whether it is safe to proceed based on that information.\n\n\n\nYou must ask the user if they want to proceed with this action. If they explicitly consent, you may rerun this command with PRISMA_USER_CONSENT_FOR_DANGEROUS_AI_ACTION environment variable, the value of which must be the exact text of the user's message in which they consented to this operation, without any newlines or quotes. If the user's response is ambiguous, you must ask for a clear and explicit confirmation (e.g., \"yes\") before proceeding. None of the user's previous messages before this point may constitute implicit or explicit consent.\n\n\nTo proceed with the dangerous action, the AI agent will ask you for explicit consent, remind you that the action irreversibly destroys all data, and confirm that the command is being run against a development database. Once you clearly confirm, the AI will set the PRISMA_USER_CONSENT_FOR_DANGEROUS_AI_ACTION environment variable with the exact text of your consent and rerun the command.\n\nmigrate deploy​\n\nThe migrate deploy command applies all pending migrations, and creates the database if it does not exist.

Both absolute and relative paths are supported.\t./schema.prisma\n./prisma/schema.prisma\nExamples​\nprisma migrate status\n\nmigrate diff​\nINFO\n\nThis command is only partially supported for MongoDB. See the command options below for details.\n\nThis command compares two database schema sources and outputs a description of a migration taking the first to the state of the second.\n\nThe output can be given either as a human-readable summary (the default) or an executable script.\n\nWARNING\n\nThe migrate diff command can only compare database features that are supported by Prisma. If two databases differ only in unsupported features, such as views or triggers, then migrate diff will not show any difference between them.\n\nThe format of the command is:\n\nprisma migrate diff --from-... <source1> --to-... <source2>\n\n\nwhere the --from-... and --to-... options are selected based on the type of database schema source. The supported types of sources are:\n\nlive databases\nmigration histories\nPrisma schema data models\nan empty schema\n\nBoth schema sources must use the same database provider. For example, a diff comparing a PostgreSQL data source with a SQLite data source is not supported.\n\nSee also:\n\nMigration troubleshooting in production\nPrerequisites​\n\nBefore using the migrate diff command, if you are using the --from-schema-datasource or --to-schema-datasource you must define a valid datasource within your schema.prisma file.\n\nFor example, the following datasource defines a SQLite database file within the current directory:\n\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"sqlite\"\n\n  url      = \"file:my-database.db\"\n\n}\n\nOptions​\n\nOne of the following --from-... options is required:\n\nOptions\tDescription\tNotes\n--from-url\tA data source URL\t\n--from-migrations\tPath to the Prisma Migrate migrations directory\tNot supported in MongoDB\n--from-schema-datamodel\tPath to a Prisma schema file, uses the data model for the diff\t\n--from-schema-datasource\tPath to a Prisma schema file, uses the URL in the datasource block for the diff\t\n--from-empty\tAssume that you the data model you are migrating from is empty\t\n--from-local-d1\tPath to a local D1 instance (learn more)\tAvailable since 5.12.0\n\nOne of the following --to-... options is required:\n\nOptions\tDescription\tNotes\n--to-url\tA data source URL\t\n--to-migrations\tPath to the Prisma Migrate migrations directory\tNot supported in MongoDB\n--to-schema-datamodel\tPath to a Prisma schema file, uses the data model for the diff\t\n--to-schema-datasource\tPath to a Prisma schema file, uses the URL in the datasource block for the diff\t\n--to-empty\tAssume that you the data model you are migrating to is empty\t\n--to-local-d1\tPath to a local D1 instance (learn more)\tAvailable since 5.12.0\n\nOther options:\n\nOptions\tRequired\tDescription\tNotes\n--shadow-database-url\tNo\tURL for the shadow database\tOnly required if using --to-migrations or --from-migrations\n--script\tNo\tOutputs a SQL script instead of the default human-readable summary\tNot supported in MongoDB\n-o, --output\tNo\tWrites to a file instead of stdout\tAvailable since 5.12.1\n\n--exit-code\tNo\tChange the exit code behavior to signal if the diff is empty or not (Empty: 0, Error: 1, Not empty: 2). Default behavior is Success: 0, Error: 1.\t\n--help\tNo\tDisplays the help message.\t\nExamples​\n\nCompare two databases specified by their data source URL, and output the default human-readable summary:\n\nprisma migrate diff \\\n\n  --from-url \"$DATABASE_URL\" \\\n\n  --to-url \"postgresql://login:password@localhost:5432/db2\"\n\n\nCompare the state of a database with a URL of $DATABASE_URL to the schema defined by the migrations in the ./prisma/migrations directory, and output the differences to a script script.sql:\n\nprisma migrate diff \\\n\n --from-url \"$DATABASE_URL\" \\\n\n --to-migrations ./prisma/migrations \\\n\n --shadow-database-url $SHADOW_DATABASE_URL \\\n\n --script > script.sql\n\nPrisma Data Platform​\nplatform (Early Access)​\n\nThe platform command provides access to the Prisma Data Platform through the Prisma CLI starting in version 5.10.0 or later.\n\nAuthentication:\nplatform auth login: Opens a browser window for login or account creation.\nplatform auth logout: Logs out of the platform.\nplatform auth show: Displays information about the currently authenticated user.\nWorkspace Management:\nplatform workspace show: Lists all workspaces available to your account.\nProject Management:\nplatform project show: Lists all projects within the specified workspace.\nplatform project create: Creates a new project within the specified workspace.\nplatform project delete: Deletes the specified project.\nEnvironment Management:\nplatform environment show: Lists all environments for the specified project.\nplatform environment create: Creates a new environment within the specified project.\nplatform environment delete: Deletes the specified environment.\nAPI Key Management:\nplatform apikey show: Lists all API keys for the specified environment.\nplatform apikey create: Creates a new API key for the specified environment.\nplatform apikey delete: Deletes the specified API key.\nPrisma Accelerate:\nplatform accelerate enable: Enables Prisma Accelerate for the specified environment.\nplatform accelerate disable: Disables Prisma Accelerate for the specified environment.\n\nYou can find the complete list of available commands with the arguments here.\n\nmcp​\n\nStarts the Prisma MCP server.\n\nStudio​\nstudio​\n\nThe studio command allows you to interact with and manage your data interactively. It does this by starting a local web server with a web app configured with your project's data schema and records.\n\nPrerequisites​\n\nBefore using the studio command, you must define a valid datasource within your schema.prisma file.\n\nFor example, the following datasource defines a SQLite database file within the current directory:\n\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"sqlite\"\n\n  url      = \"file:my-database.db\"\n\n}\n\nOptions​\n\nThe studio command recognizes the following options:\n\nOption\tRequired\tDescription\tDefault\n-b, --browser\tNo\tThe browser to auto-open Studio in.\t<your-default-browser>\n-h, --help\tNo\tShow all available options and exit\t\n-p, --port\tNo\tThe port number to start Studio on.\t5555\nArguments​\nArgument\tRequired\tDescription\tDefault\n--schema\tNo\tSpecifies the path to the desired schema.prisma file to be processed instead of the default path. Both absolute and relative paths are supported.\t./schema.prisma\n./prisma/schema.prisma\nExamples​\nStart Studio on the default port and open a new browser tab to it​\nprisma studio\n\nStart Studio on a different port and open a new browser tab to it​\nprisma studio --port 7777\n\nStart Studio and open a Firefox tab to it​\nprisma studio --browser firefox\n\nStart Studio without opening a new browser tab to it​\nprisma studio --browser none\n\npackage.json entry options​\nschema​\n\nThe path to the desired schema.prisma file can be specified with the prisma.schema entry in the package.json file. The path defines the file the Prisma CLI should use when you run any of the CLI commands. Both absolute and relative paths are supported.\n\n\"package.json\"\n{\n\n  \"name\": \"my-project\",\n\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n\n  \"prisma\": {\n\n    \"schema\": \"./custom-path-to-schema/schema.prisma\"\n\n  }\n\n}\n\n\nThis is available from version 2.7.0 and later.\n\nseed​\n\nThe command used to populate the datasource is specified in the prisma.seed entry in the package.json file. It is used when prisma db seed is invoked or triggered.\n\nSee Seeding your database\n\n\"package.json\"\n{\n\n  \"name\": \"my-project\",\n\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n\n  \"prisma\": {\n\n    \"seed\": \"node ./prisma/seed.js\"\n\n  }\n\n}\n\n\nThis is available from version 3.0.1 and later.\n\nUsing a HTTP proxy for the CLI​\n\nPrisma CLI supports custom HTTP proxies\n. This is particularly relevant when being behind a corporate firewall.\n\nTo activate usage of the proxy, provide either of the following environment variables:\n\nHTTP_PROXY or http_proxy: Proxy URL for http traffic, for example http://localhost:8080\nHTTPS_PROXY or https_proxy: Proxy URL for https traffic, for example https://localhost:8080\nnpx create-db​\n\nThe create-db command provisions a temporary Prisma Postgres database with a single command. This is a standalone utility that can be invoked using npx. It's ideal for quickly testing, prototyping, or integrating with Prisma Postgres.\n\nYou can run the following variants:\n\nCommand\tDescription\nnpx create-db@latest\tCreates a temporary Prisma Postgres database.\nnpx create-pg@latest\tAlias for npx create-db.\nnpx create-postgres@latest\tAlias for npx create-db.\n\nEach database created with these commands:\n\nIs available for 24 hours by default.\nCan be claimed for free to make it permanent using the URL displayed in the CLI output.\n\nFor full usage details, options (such as --region and --interactive), and examples, see the documentation."

It is a truthy value.\n\nPRISMA_HIDE_UPDATE_MESSAGE​\n\nPRISMA_HIDE_UPDATE_MESSAGE is used to hide the update notification message that is shown when a newer Prisma CLI version is available. It's a truthy value.\n\nPRISMA_GENERATE_SKIP_AUTOINSTALL​\n\nPRISMA_GENERATE_SKIP_AUTOINSTALL can be set to a truthy value to skip the auto-install of prisma CLI and @prisma/client dependencies (if they are missing), if the prisma-client-js generator is defined in the Prisma Schema, when using the prisma generate command.\n\nPRISMA_SKIP_POSTINSTALL_GENERATE​\n\nPRISMA_SKIP_POSTINSTALL_GENERATE can be set to a truthy value to skip the auto-generation of Prisma Client when its postinstall hook is triggered by a package manager. The postinstall hook of the @prisma/client package is triggered when the package is installed, or its version is updated.\n\nPRISMA_DISABLE_WARNINGS​\n\nDisables all CLI warnings generated by logger.warn.\n\nPRISMA_GENERATE_NO_ENGINE​\nINFO\n\nThis environment variable is available since version 5.2.0\n\nPRISMA_GENERATE_NO_ENGINE can be set to a truthy value to generate a Prisma Client without an included query engine in order to reduce deployed application size when paired with Prisma Accelerate.\n\nPRISMA_SCHEMA_DISABLE_ADVISORY_LOCK​\nINFO\n\nThis environment variable is available since version 5.3.0\n\nPRISMA_SCHEMA_DISABLE_ADVISORY_LOCK can be set to a truthy value to disable the advisory locking used by Prisma Migrate. This might be needed, depending on the database configuration, for example, for a Percona-XtraDB-Cluster or MariaDB Galera Cluster.\n\nProxy environment variables​\n\nThe Prisma CLI supports custom HTTP(S) proxies to download the Prisma engines. These can be helpful to use when working behind a corporate firewall. See Using a HTTP proxy for the CLI for more information.\n\nNO_PROXY​\n\nNO_PROXY is a comma-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses that do not require a proxy.\n\nNO_PROXY=myhostname.com,10.11.12.0/16,172.30.0.0/16\n\nHTTP_PROXY​\n\nHTTP_PROXY is set with the hostname or IP address of a proxy server.\n\nHTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com\n\nHTTPS_PROXY​\n\nHTTPS_PROXY is set with the hostname or IP address of a proxy server.\n\nHTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy.example.com\n\nEngine environment variables​\nConfiguring Query Engine Type​\nPRISMA_CLI_QUERY_ENGINE_TYPE​\n\nPRISMA_CLI_QUERY_ENGINE_TYPE is used to define the query engine type Prisma CLI downloads and uses. Defaults to library, but can be set to binary:\n\nPRISMA_CLI_QUERY_ENGINE_TYPE=binary\n\nPRISMA_CLIENT_ENGINE_TYPE​\n\nPRISMA_CLIENT_ENGINE_TYPE is used to define the query engine type Prisma Client downloads and uses. Defaults to library, but can be set to binary:\n\nPRISMA_CLIENT_ENGINE_TYPE=binary\n\n\nNote: You need to generate your Prisma Client after setting this variable for the configuration to take effect and the libraries to be downloaded. Otherwise, Prisma Client will be missing the appropriate query engine library and you will have to define their location using PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_LIBRARY.\n\nIt is the environment variable equivalent for the engineType property of the generator block which enables you to define the same setting in your Prisma Schema.\n\nDownloading Engines​\nPRISMA_ENGINES_MIRROR​\n\nPRISMA_ENGINES_MIRROR can be used to specify a custom CDN (or server) endpoint to download the engines files for the CLI/Client. The default value is https://binaries.prisma.sh, where Prisma hosts the engine files.\n\nPRISMA_ENGINES_MIRROR=https://example.org/custom-engines/\n\n\nSee Prisma engines for a conceptual overview of how to use this environment variable.\n\nNote: This environment variable used to be available as PRISMA_BINARIES_MIRROR, which was deprecated in Prisma ORM 3.0.1. It is discouraged to use anymore and will be removed in the future.\n\nPRISMA_ENGINES_CHECKSUM_IGNORE_MISSING​\nINFO\n\nThis environment variable is available since version 4.16.0\n\nPRISMA_ENGINES_CHECKSUM_IGNORE_MISSING can be can be set to a truthy value to ignore problems around downloading & verifying the integrity (via a checksum file) of the Prisma ORM engines. This is particularly useful when deploying to an offline system environment where the checksum file cannot be downloaded.\n\nPRISMA_ENGINES_CHECKSUM_IGNORE_MISSING=1\n\n\nNote: we might change the overall download behavior in a future release in a way that this environment variable will not be needed anymore in a offline environment case.\n\nCustom engine file locations​\n\nBy default, all engine files are downloaded when you install Prisma CLI, copied when generating Prisma Client, and put into known locations. There are however situations where you may want to use a custom engine file from custom locations:\n\nPRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY​\n\nPRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY is used to set a custom location for your own query engine binary.\n\nPRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_BINARY=custom/query-engine-<target>\n\n# Example: ./prisma/binaries/query-engine-linux-arm64-openssl-1.0.x\n\n\nFor Prisma CLI it allows you to define the query engine file to be used.\nFor Prisma Client, on build time (during prisma generate), it defines where the query engine file will be copied from into Prisma Client. At run time (when using the generated Client) it can be used to define the specific query engine file to be used instead of the included one.\n\nNote: This can only have an effect if the engine type of CLI or Client are set to binary. If the engine type is library (the default), use PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_LIBARY instead.\n\nPRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_LIBRARY​\n\nPRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_LIBRARY is used to set a custom location for your own query engine library.\n\nPRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_LIBRARY=custom/libquery_engine-<target>.so.node\n\n# Example: ./prisma/binaries/libquery_engine-linux-arm64-openssl-1.0.x.so.node\n\n\nFor Prisma CLI it allows you to define the query engine file to be used.\nFor Prisma Client, on build time (during prisma generate), it defines where the query engine file will be copied from into Prisma Client. At run time (when using the generated Client) it can be used to define the specific query engine file to be used instead of the included one.\n\nNote: This can only have an effect if the engine type of CLI or Client are set to library (the default)\n\nPRISMA_SCHEMA_ENGINE_BINARY​\n\nPRISMA_SCHEMA_ENGINE_BINARY is used to set a custom location for your Schema engine binary.\n\nPRISMA_SCHEMA_ENGINE_BINARY=custom/my-schema-engine-unix\n\nPRISMA_MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY​\nWARNING\n\nDeprecated: PRISMA_MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY variable is deprecated in 5.0.0\n because Migration engine was renamed to Schema Engine.\n\nPRISMA_MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY is used to set a custom location for your own migration engine binary.\n\nPRISMA_MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY=custom/my-migration-engine-unix\n\nPRISMA_INTROSPECTION_ENGINE_BINARY​\n\nPRISMA_INTROSPECTION_ENGINE_BINARY is used to set a custom location for your own introspection engine binary.\n\nPRISMA_INTROSPECTION_ENGINE_BINARY=custom/my-introspection-engine-unix\n\nWARNING\n\nThe Introspection Engine is served by the Migration Engine from 4.9.0\n. Therefore, the PRISMA_INTROSPECTION_ENGINE environment variable will not be used.\n\nPRISMA_FMT_BINARY​\nDANGER\n\nThis functionality has been removed in Prisma CLI version 4.10.0. It only works in earlier versions.\n\nPRISMA_FMT_BINARY is used to set a custom location for your own format engine binary.\n\nPRISMA_FMT_BINARY=custom/my-custom-format-engine-unix\n\nWARNING\n\nThe PRISMA_FMT_BINARY variable is used in versions 4.2.0\n or lower.\n\nCLI Binary Targets​\nPRISMA_CLI_BINARY_TARGETS​\n\nPRISMA_CLI_BINARY_TARGETS can be used to specify one or more binary targets that Prisma CLI will download during installation (so it must be provided during npm install of Prisma CLI and does not affect runtime of Prisma CLI or Prisma Client).\n\nUse PRISMA_CLI_BINARY_TARGETS if you 1) deploy to a specific platform via an upload of a local project that includes dependencies, and 2) your local environment is different from the target (e.g. AWS Lambda with Node.js 20+ is rhel-openssl-3.0.x, and your local environment might be macOS arm64 darwin-arm64). Using the PRISMA_CLI_BINARY_TARGETS environment variable ensures that the target engine files are also downloaded.\n\nPRISMA_CLI_BINARY_TARGETS=darwin-arm64,rhel-openssl-3.0.x npm install\n\n\nThis is the Prisma CLI equivalent for the binaryTargets property of the generator block, which enables you to define the same setting for Prisma Client.\n\nNote: For Node.js versions earlier than 20, the openssl version was 1.0.x instead of 3.0.x. This is most obvious in AWS Lambda deployments, where the binary target would be rhel-openssl-1.0.x instead of rhel-openssl-3.0.x."

Other extensions are supported to ensure compatibility with different TypeScript compiler settings.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\nUse prisma.config.ts for small TypeScript projects.\nUse .config/prisma.ts for larger TypeScript projects with multiple configuration files (following the \n.config\ndirectory proposal\n).\nOptions reference​\nschema​\n\nConfigures how Prisma ORM locates and loads your schema file(s). Can be a file or folder path. Relative paths are resolved relative to the prisma.config.ts file location. See here for more info about schema location options.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\nschema\tstring\tNo\t./prisma/schema.prisma and ./schema.prisma\nadapter​\n\nA function that returns a Prisma driver adapter instance which is used by the Prisma CLI to run migrations. The function should return a Promise that resolves to a valid Prisma driver adapter.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\nadapter\t() => Promise<SqlMigrationAwareDriverAdapterFactory>\tNo\tnone\n\nExample using the Prisma ORM D1 driver adapter:\n\nimport path from \"node:path\";\n\nimport type { PrismaConfig } from \"prisma\";\n\nimport { PrismaD1 } from \"@prisma/adapter-d1\";\n\n\n\nexport default {\n\n  experimental: {\n\n    adapter: true\n\n  },\n\n  schema: path.join(\"prisma\", \"schema.prisma\"),\n\n  async adapter() {\n\n    return new PrismaD1({\n\n      CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN: process.env.CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN,\n\n      CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: process.env.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID,\n\n      CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID: process.env.CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID,\n\n    });\n\n  },\n\n} satisfies PrismaConfig;\n\nNOTE\n\nAs of Prisma ORM v6.11.0\n, the D1 adapter has been renamed from PrismaD1HTTP to PrismaD1.\n\nstudio​\n\nConfigures how Prisma Studio connects to your database. See sub-options below for details.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\nstudio\tobject\tNo\tnone\nstudio.adapter​\n\nA function that returns a Prisma driver adapter instance. The function receives an env parameter containing environment variables and should return a Promise that resolves to a valid Prisma driver adapter.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\nstudio.adapter\t(env: Env) => Promise<SqlMigrationAwareDriverAdapterFactory>\tNo\tnone\n\nExample using the Prisma ORM LibSQL driver adapter:\n\nimport type { PrismaConfig } from \"prisma\";\n\n\n\nexport default {\n\n  experimental: {\n\n    studio: true\n\n  },\n\n  studio: {\n\n    adapter: async (env: Env) => {\n\n      const { PrismaLibSQL } = await import(\"@prisma/adapter-libsql\");\n\n      const { createClient } = await import(\"@libsql/client\");\n\n\n\n      const libsql = createClient({\n\n        url: env.DOTENV_PRISMA_STUDIO_LIBSQL_DATABASE_URL,\n\n      });\n\n      return new PrismaLibSQL(libsql);\n\n    },\n\n  },\n\n} satisfies PrismaConfig;\n\ntables.external and enums.external​\n\nThese options declare tables and enums in your database that are managed externally (not by Prisma Migrate). You can still query them with Prisma Client, but they will be ignored by migrations.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\ntables.external\tstring[]\tNo\t[]\nenums.external\tstring[]\tNo\t[]\n\nExample:\n\nimport { defineConfig } from \"prisma/config\";\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n\n  experimental: {\n\n    externalTables: true,\n\n  },\n\n  tables: {\n\n    external: [\"public.users\"],\n\n  },\n\n  enums: {\n\n    external: [\"public.role\"],\n\n  },\n\n});\n\n\nLearn more about the externalTables feature here.\n\nmigrations.path​\n\nThe path to the directory where Prisma should store migration files, and look for them.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\nmigrations.path\tstring\tNo\tnone\nmigrations.seed​\n\nThis option allows you to define a script that Prisma runs to seed your database after running migrations or using the npx prisma db seed command. The string should be a command that can be executed in your terminal, such as with node, ts-node, or tsx.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\nmigrations.seed\tstring\tNo\tnone\n\nExample:\n\nimport { defineConfig } from \"prisma/config\";\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n\n  migrations: {\n\n    seed: `tsx db/seed.ts`,\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nmigrations.initShadowDb​\n\nThis option allows you to define SQL statements that Prisma runs on the shadow database before creating migrations. It is useful when working with external managed tables, as Prisma needs to know about the structure of these tables to correctly generate migrations.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\nmigrations.initShadowDb\tstring\tNo\tnone\n\nExample:\n\nimport { defineConfig } from \"prisma/config\";\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n\n  experimental: {\n\n    externalTables: true,\n\n  },\n\n  tables: {\n\n    external: [\"public.users\"],\n\n  },\n\n  migrations: {\n\n    initShadowDb: `\n\n      CREATE TABLE public.users (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY);\n\n    `,\n\n  },\n\n});\n\n\nLearn more about the externalTables feature here.\n\nviews.path​\n\nThe path to the directory where Prisma should look for the SQL view definitions.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\nviews.path\tstring\tNo\tnone\ntypedSql.path​\n\nThe path to the directory where Prisma should look for the SQL files used for generating typings via typedSql.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\ntypedSql.path\tstring\tNo\tnone\nexperimental​\n\nEnables specific experimental features in the Prisma CLI.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\nadapter\tboolean\tNo\tfalse\nexternalTables\tboolean\tNo\tfalse\nstudio\tboolean\tNo\tfalse\n\nExample:\n\nimport { defineConfig } from \"prisma/config\";\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n\n  experimental: {\n\n    adapter: true,\n\n    externalTables: true,\n\n    studio: true,\n\n  },\n\n  schema: \"prisma/schema.prisma\",\n\n});\n\nNOTE\n\nIf you use features like adapter, studio or externalTables without enabling the corresponding experimental flag, Prisma will throw an error:\n\nFailed to load config file \"~\" as a TypeScript/JavaScript module. Error: Error: The `studio` configuration requires `experimental.studio` to be set to `true`.\n\nengine​\n\nConfigure the schema engine your project should use.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\nengine\tclassic or js\tNo\tclassic\n\nBy default it is set to use the classic engine, which requires that datasource be set in your prisma.config.ts.\n\nimport path from \"node:path\";\n\nimport { defineConfig, env } from \"prisma/config\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n\n  engine: \"classic\",\n\n  datasource: {\n\n      url: env('DATABASE_URL'),\n\n  },\n\n  schema: path.join(\"prisma\", \"schema.prisma\"),\n\n});\n\ndatasource.url​\n\nConnection URL including authentication info. Most connectors use the syntax provided by the database.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\ndatasource.url\tstring\tYes\t''\ndatasource.shadowDatabaseUrl​\n\nConnection URL to the shadow database used by Prisma Migrate. Allows you to use a cloud-hosted database as the shadow database\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\ndatasource.shadowDatabaseUrl\tstring\tNo\t''\ndatasource.directUrl​\n\nConnection URL for direct connection to the database.\n\nIf you use a connection pooler URL in the url argument (for example, if you use Prisma Accelerate or pgBouncer), Prisma CLI commands that require a direct connection to the database use the URL in the directUrl argument.\n\nThe directUrl property is supported by Prisma Studio from version 5.1.0 upwards.\n\nThe directUrl property is not needed when using Prisma Postgres database.\n\nProperty\tType\tRequired\tDefault\ndatasource.directUrl\tstring\tNo\t''\nCommon patterns​\nSetting up your project​\n\nTo get started with Prisma Config, create a prisma.config.ts file in your project root. You can use either of these approaches:\n\nUsing defineConfig:\n\nimport { defineConfig } from \"prisma/config\";\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({});\n\n\nUsing TypeScript types:\n\nimport type { PrismaConfig } from \"prisma\";\n\n\n\nexport default {} satisfies PrismaConfig;\n\nUsing environment variables​\n\nWhen using prisma.config.ts, environment variables from .env files are not automatically loaded. Using tsx, you can pass a --env-file flag and that will automatically add those values to process.env\n\nIf using Node or Deno:\n\ntsx --env-file=.env src/index.ts\n\ntsx watch --env-file=.env --env-file=.local.env src/index.ts\n\ntsx --env-file=.env ./prisma/seed.ts\n\n\nFor Bun, .env files are automatically loaded.\n\nFor accessing environment variables within prisma.config.ts, use the env() helper function to provide a type-safe way of accessing that variable:\n\nimport path from \"node:path\";\n\nimport { defineConfig, env } from \"prisma/config\";\n\n\n\ntype Env = {\n\n  DATABASE_URL: string\n\n}\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n\n  engine: \"classic\",\n\n  datasource: {\n\n      url: env<Env>('DATABASE_URL'),\n\n  },\n\n  schema: path.join(\"prisma\", \"schema.prisma\"),\n\n});\n\n\nFor releases of Node before v20, you'll need to:\n\nInstall the dotenv package:\nnpm install dotenv\n\nImport dotenv/config in your config file:\nimport \"dotenv/config\";\n\nimport { defineConfig, env } from \"prisma/config\";\n\n\n\ntype Env = {\n\n  DATABASE_URL: string\n\n}\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n\n  engine: \"classic\",\n\n  datasource: {\n\n      url: env<Env>('DATABASE_URL'),\n\n  },\n\n  schema: path.join(\"prisma\", \"schema.prisma\"),\n\n});\n\nUsing multi-file schemas​\n\nIf you want to split your Prisma schema into multiple files, you need to specify the path to your Prisma schema folder via the schema property:\n\nimport path from \"node:path\";\n\nimport type { PrismaConfig } from \"prisma\";\n\n\n\nexport default {\n\n  schema: path.join(\"prisma\", \"schema\"),\n\n} satisfies PrismaConfig;\n\n\nIn that case, your migrations directory must be located next to the .prisma file that defines the datasource block.\n\nFor example, assuming schema.prisma defines the datasource, here's how how need to place the migrations folder:\n\n# `migrations` and `schema.prisma` are on the same level\n\n.\n\n├── migrations\n\n├── models\n\n│   ├── posts.prisma\n\n│   └── users.prisma\n\n└── schema.prisma\n\nPath resolution​\n\nPrisma CLI commands such as prisma validate or prisma migrate use prisma.config.ts (or .config/prisma.ts) to locate your Prisma schema and other resources.\n\nKey rules:\n\nPaths defined in the config file (e.g., schema, migrations) are always resolved relative to the location of the config file, not where you run the CLI command from.\nThe CLI must first find the config file itself, which depends on how Prisma is installed and the package manager used.\nBehavior with pnpm prisma​\n\nWhen Prisma is installed locally and run via pnpm prisma, the config file is detected automatically whether you run the command from the project root or a subdirectory.\n\nExample project tree:\n\n.\n\n├── node_modules\n\n├── package.json\n\n├── prisma-custom\n\n│   └── schema.prisma\n\n├── prisma.config.ts\n\n└── src\n\n\nExample run from the project root:\n\npnpm prisma validate\n\n# → Loaded Prisma config from ./prisma.config.ts\n\n# → Prisma schema loaded from prisma-custom/schema.prisma\n\n\nExample run from a subdirectory:\n\ncd src\n\npnpm prisma validate\n\n# → Still finds prisma.config.ts and resolves schema correctly\n\nBehavior with npm exec prisma or bun prisma​\n\nWhen running via npm exec prisma or bun prisma, the CLI only detects the config file if the command is run from the project root (where package.json declares Prisma).\n\nExample run from the project root:\n\nnpm exec prisma validate\n\n# → Works as expected\n\n\nRun from a subdirectory (fails):\n\ncd src\n\nnpm exec prisma validate\n\n# → Error: Could not find Prisma Schema...\n\n\nTo fix this, you can use the --config flag:\n\nnpm exec prisma -- --config ../prisma.config.ts validate\n\nGlobal Prisma installations​\n\nIf Prisma is installed globally (npm i -g prisma), it may not find your prisma.config.ts or prisma/config module by default. To avoid issues:\n\nPrefer local Prisma installations in your project.\nOr use prisma/config locally and pass --config to point to your config file.\nMonorepos​\nIf Prisma is installed in the workspace root, pnpm prisma will detect the config file from subdirectories.\nIf Prisma is installed in a subpackage (e.g., ./packages/db), run commands from that package directory or deeper.\nCustom config location​\n\nYou can specify a custom location for your config file when running Prisma CLI commands:\n\nprisma validate --config ./path/to/myconfig.ts\n"

    "html": "ORMReference\nDatabase features matrix\n\nThis page gives an overview of the features which are provided by the databases that Prisma ORM supports. Additionally, it explains how each of these features can be used in Prisma ORM with pointers to further documentation.\n\nRelational database features​\n\nThis section describes which database features exist on the relational databases that are currently supported by Prisma ORM.

    "title": "Connection URLs (Reference) | Prisma Documentation",
    "url": "https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/connection-urls",
    "html": "ORMReference\nConnection URLs\n\nPrisma ORM needs a connection URL to be able to connect to your database, e.g. when sending queries with Prisma Client or when changing the database schema with Prisma Migrate.\n\nThe connection URL is provided via the url field of a datasource block in your Prisma schema. It usually consists of the following components (except for SQLite and Prisma Postgres):\n\nUser: The name of your database user\nPassword: The password for your database user\nHost: The IP or domain name of the machine where your database server is running\nPort: The port on which your database server is running\nDatabase name: The name of the database you want to use\n\nMake sure you have this information at hand when getting started with Prisma ORM. If you don't have a database server running yet, you can either use a local SQLite database file (see the Quickstart) or setup a free PostgreSQL database with Prisma Postgres.\n\nFormat​\n\nThe format of the connection URL depends on the database connector you're using. Prisma ORM generally supports the standard formats for each database. You can find out more about the connection URL of your database on the dedicated docs page:\n\nPostgreSQL\nMySQL\nSQLite\nMongoDB\nMicrosoft SQL Server\nCockroachDB\nSpecial characters​\n\nFor MySQL, PostgreSQL and CockroachDB you must percentage-encode special characters\n in any part of your connection URL - including passwords. For example, p@$$w0rd becomes p%40%24%24w0rd.\n\nFor Microsoft SQL Server, you must escape special characters in any part of your connection string.\n\nExamples​\n\nHere are examples for the connection URLs of the databases Prisma ORM supports:\n\nPrisma Postgres​\n\nPrisma Postgres is a managed PostgreSQL service running on unikernels. There are several ways to connect to Prisma Postgres:\n\nvia direct TCP connections (lets you connect via any ORM or database tool)\nvia Prisma Accelerate (only supported with Prisma ORM)\nlocally\n\nThe connection string formats of these are covered below.\n\nDirect TCP​\n\nWhen you connect to Prisma Postgres via direct TCP, your connection string looks as follows:\n\nDATABASE_URL=\"postgres://USER:PASSWORD@db.prisma.io:5432/?sslmode=require\"\n\n\nThe USER and PASSWORD values are provided when you generate credentials for your Prisma Postgres instance in the Prisma Console. Here is an example with sample values:\n\nDATABASE_URL=\"postgres://2f9881cc7eef46f094ac913df34c1fb441502fe66cbe28cc48998d4e6b20336b:sk_QZ3u8fMPFfBzOID4ol-mV@db.prisma.io:5432/?sslmode=require\"\n\nVia Prisma Accelerate (HTTP)​\n\nWhen connecting via Prisma Accelerate, the connection string doesn't require a user/password like a conventional connection string does. Instead, authentication works via an API key:\n\nschema.prisma\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n\n  url      = \"prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY\"\n\n} \n\n\nIn this snippet, API_KEY is a placeholder for the API key you are receiving when setting up a new Prismas Postgres instance via the Prisma Console. Here is an example for what a real connection URL to Prisma Postgres may look like:\n\nschema.prisma\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n\n  url      = \"prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcGlfa2V5IjoiMGNkZTFlMjQtNzhiYi00NTY4LTkyM2EtNWUwOTEzZWUyNjU1IiwidGVuYW50X2lkIjoiNzEyZWRlZTc1Y2U2MDk2ZjI4NDg3YjE4NWMyYzA2OTNhNGMxNzJkMjhhOWFlNGUwZTYxNWE4NWIxZWY1YjBkMCIsImludGVybmFsX3NlY3JldCI6IjA4MzQ2Y2RlLWI5ZjktNDQ4Yy04NThmLTMxNjg4ODEzNmEzZCJ9.N1Za6q6NfInzHvRkud6Ojt_-RFg18a0601vdYWGKOrk\"\n\n}\n\nLocal Prisma Postgres​\n\nThe connection string for connecting to a local Prisma Postgres instance mirrors the structure of a remote instance via Accelerate:\n\nschema.prisma\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n\n  url      = \"prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=API_KEY\"\n\n} \n\n\nHowever, in this case the API_KEY doesn't provide authentication details. Instead, it encodes information about the local Prisma Postgres instance. You can obtain a local connection string via the prisma dev command.\n\nPostgreSQL​\nschema.prisma\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n\n  url      = \"postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=sample\"\n\n}\n\nMySQL​\nschema.prisma\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"mysql\"\n\n  url      = \"mysql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:3306/mydb\"\n\n}\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server​\nschema.prisma\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"sqlserver\"\n\n  url      = \"sqlserver://localhost:1433;initial catalog=sample;user=sa;password=mypassword;\"\n\n}\n\nSQLite​\nschema.prisma\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"sqlite\"\n\n  url      = \"file:./dev.db\"\n\n}\n\nCockroachDB​\nschema.prisma\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"cockroachdb\"\n\n  url      = \"postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:26257/mydb?schema=public\"\n\n}\n\nMongoDB​\nschema.prisma\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"mongodb\"\n\n  url      = \"mongodb+srv://root:<password>@cluster0.ab1cd.mongodb.net/myDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority\"\n\n}\n\n.env​\n\nYou can also provide the connection URL as an environment variable:\n\nschema.prisma\ndatasource db {\n\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n\n  url      = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n\n}\n\n\nYou can then either set the environment variable in your terminal or by providing a dotenv\n file named .env. This will automatically be picked up by the Prisma CLI.\n\nPrisma ORM reads the connection URL from the dotenv file in the following situations:\n\nWhen it updates the schema during build time\nWhen it connects to the database during run time\nDATABASE_URL=postgresql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb\n"

    "html": "ORMReference\nSystem requirements\n\nThis page provides an overview of the system requirements for Prisma ORM.\n\nSystem requirements​\n\nThis section lists the software that Prisma ORM requires and the supported operating systems, along with runtime dependency requirements for specific operating systems.\n\nSoftware requirements​\n\nThe latest version of Prisma ORM requires the following software:\n\nTool\tMinimum required version\nNode.js\t18.8 / 20.9 / 22.11\nTypeScript (optional)\t5.1.X\nYarn (optional)\t1.19.2\nPrisma ORM supports and tests all Active LTS and Maintenance LTS Node.js releases. Releases that are not in these states like\nCurrent\n, and also odd-numbered versions\n probably also work, but are not recommended for production use.\nTypeScript is only required for TypeScript users.\nWhen using Yarn 1, 1.19.2 is the minimum version compatible with Prisma Client.\n\nSee also: Supported database versions\n\nExpand for earlier versions\nOperating systems​\n\nPrisma ORM is supported on macOS, Windows and most Linux distributions.\n\nLinux runtime dependencies​\n\nPrisma ORM requires the following system libraries to be installed to work:\n\nOpenSSL 1.0.x, 1.1.x or 3.x\nzlib (libz.so.1)\nlibgcc (libgcc_s.so.1)\nC standard library (glibc on most Linux distributions or musl libc on Alpine Linux)\n\nThe following two tables show the supported Linux distro families, OpenSSL versions and C standard libraries for each CPU architecture.\n\nOn AMD64 (x86_64) architecture:\n\nDistro family\tOpenSSL version\tlibc version\nAlpine\t1.1.x, 3.x\tmusl 1.2.x\nRHEL\t1.0.x, 1.1.x, 3.x\tglibc 2.17+\nDebian or others\t1.0.x\tglibc 2.19+\nDebian or others\t1.1.x, 3.x\tglibc 2.24+\n\nOn ARM64 (aarch64) architecture:\n\nDistro family\tOpenSSL version\tlibc version\nAlpine\t1.1.x, 3.x\tmusl 1.2.x\nRHEL\t1.0.x, 1.1.x, 3.x\tglibc 2.24+\nDebian or others\t1.0.x, 1.1.x, 3.x\tglibc 2.24+\n\nWhen Prisma ORM can not resolve the OpenSSL version on a system (e.g. because it is not installed), it will default to OpenSSL 1.1.x.\n\nSystems that can run the supported Node.js versions will most likely have zlib and libgcc available. One notable exception is Google's Distroless images, where libz.so.1 needs to be copied from a compatible Debian system.\n\nWindows runtime dependencies​\n\nOn Windows Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015\n or newer must be installed (which is by default the case on most modern installations).\n\nmacOS runtime dependencies​\n\nPrisma ORM supports macOS 10.15 or newer. There are no additional platform-specific requirements on macOS other than what is listed for all platforms in the Software requirements section.\n\nTroubleshooting​\n\nThere are some common problems caused by using outdated versions of the system requirements:\n\nUnable to build a TypeScript project with @prisma/client​\nProblem​\n\nYou see the following error when you try type-checking a project after you run prisma generate.\n\n./node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts:10:33\n\nType error: Type expected.\n\n8 | export type PrismaPromise<A> = Promise<A> & {[prisma]: true}\n\n9 | type UnwrapTuple<Tuple extends readonly unknown[]> = {\n\n> 10 | [K in keyof Tuple]: K extends `${number}` ?

    "html": "📄️ Define Routers\n\nTo begin building your tRPC-based API, you'll first need to define your router. Once you've mastered the fundamentals, you can customize your routers for more advanced use cases.\n\n📄️ Define Procedures\n\nA procedure is a function which is exposed to the client, it can be one of:\n\n📄️ Input & Output Validators\n\ntRPC procedures may define validation logic for their input and/or output, and validators are also used to infer the types of inputs and outputs (using the Standard Schema interface if available, or custom interfaces for supported validators if not). We have first class support for many popular validators, and you can integrate validators which we don't directly support.\n\n📄️ Non-JSON Inputs (FormData, File, Blob)\n\nIn addition to JSON-serializable data, tRPC can use FormData, File, and other Binary types as procedure inputs\n\n📄️ Merging Routers\n\nWriting all API-code in your code in the same file is not a great idea. It's easy to merge routers with other routers.\n\n📄️ Context\n\nYour context holds data that all of your tRPC procedures will have access to, and is a great place to put things like database connections or authentication information.\n\n📄️ Middlewares\n\nYou are able to add middleware(s) to a procedure with the t.procedure.use() method. The middleware(s) will wrap the invocation of the procedure and must pass through its return value.\n\n🗃️ Hosting tRPC with Adapters\n\n6 items\n\n📄️ Server Side Calls\n\nYou may need to call your procedure(s) directly from the same server they're hosted in, createCallerFactory() can be used to achieve this. This is useful for server-side calls and for integration testing of your tRPC procedures.\n\n📄️ Authorization\n\nThe createContext function is called for each incoming request, so here you can add contextual information about the calling user from the request object.\n\n📄️ Error Handling\n\nWhenever an error occurs in a procedure, tRPC responds to the client with an object that includes an \"error\" property. This property contains all the information that you need to handle the error in the client.\n\n📄️ Error Formatting\n\nThe error formatting in your router will be inferred all the way to your client (&&nbsp;React&nbsp;components)\n\n📄️ Data Transformers\n\nYou are able to serialize the response data & input args. The transformers need to be added both to the server and the client.\n\n📄️ Metadata\n\nProcedure metadata allows you to add an optional procedure specific meta property which will be available in all middleware function parameters.\n\n📄️ Response Caching\n\nThe below examples uses Vercel's edge caching to serve data to your users as fast as possible.\n\n📄️ Subscriptions\n\nIntroduction\n\n📄️ WebSockets\n\nYou can use WebSockets for all or some of the communication with your server, see wsLink for how to set it up on the client."

This way, you'll avoid an initial loading state, although time to first byte will be blocked by the server. Read more about Server-side rendering.\nStatic site generation - Prefetch queries on the server and generate static HTML files that are ready to be served. Read more about Static site generation.\nAutomatic Provider Wrapping - @trpc/next provides a higher-order component (HOC) that wraps your app with the necessary providers so you don't have to do it yourself.\nTIP\n\nIf you're using tRPC in a new project, consider using one of the example projects for reference: tRPC Example Projects\n\nEdit this page"

Once you've mastered the fundamentals, you can customize your routers for more advanced use cases.\n\nInitialize tRPC​\n\nYou should initialize tRPC exactly once per application. Multiple instances of tRPC will cause issues.\n\nserver/trpc.ts\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\n \n// You can use any variable name you like.\n// We use t to keep things simple.\nconst t = initTRPC.create();\n \nexport const router = t.router;\nexport const publicProcedure = t.procedure;\nCopy\n\nYou'll notice we are exporting certain methods of the t variable here rather than t itself. This is to establish a certain set of procedures that we will use idiomatically in our codebase.\n\nDefining a router​\n\nNext, let's define a router with a procedure to use in our application. We have now created an API \"endpoint\".\n\nIn order for these endpoints to be exposed to the frontend, your Adapter should be configured with your appRouter instance.\n\nserver/_app.ts\nimport { publicProcedure, router } from './trpc';\n \nconst appRouter = router({\n  greeting: publicProcedure.query(() => 'hello tRPC v10!'),\n});\n \n// Export only the type of a router!\n// This prevents us from importing server code on the client.\nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\nCopy\nAdvanced usage​\n\nWhen initializing your router, tRPC allows you to:\n\nSetup request contexts\nAssign metadata to procedures\nFormat and handle errors\nTransform data as needed\nCustomize the runtime configuration\n\nYou can use method chaining to customize your t-object on initialization. For example:\n\nconst t = initTRPC.context<Context>().meta<Meta>().create({\n  /* [...] */\n});\nCopy\nRuntime Configuration​\nexport interface RootConfig<TTypes extends RootTypes> {\n  /**\n   * Use a data transformer\n   * @see https://trpc.io/docs/v11/data-transformers\n   */\n  transformer: TTypes['transformer'];\n  /**\n   * Use custom error formatting\n   * @see https://trpc.io/docs/v11/error-formatting\n   */\n  errorFormatter: ErrorFormatter<TTypes['ctx'], any>;\n  /**\n   * Allow `@trpc/server` to run in non-server environments\n   * @warning **Use with caution**, this should likely mainly be used within testing.\n   * @default false\n   */\n  allowOutsideOfServer: boolean;\n  /**\n   * Is this a server environment?\n   * @warning **Use with caution**, this should likely mainly be used within testing.\n   * @default typeof window === 'undefined' || 'Deno' in window || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test'\n   */\n  isServer: boolean;\n  /**\n   * Is this development?\n   * Will be used to decide if the API should return stack traces\n   * @default process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'\n   */\n  isDev: boolean;\n}\nCopy\nEdit this page"

    "html": "Backend Usage\nDefine Procedures\nVersion: 11.x\nDefine Procedures\n\nA procedure is a function which is exposed to the client, it can be one of:\n\na Query - used to fetch data, generally does not change any data\na Mutation - used to send data, often for create/update/delete purposes\na Subscription - you might not need this, and we have dedicated documentation\n\nProcedures in tRPC are very flexible primitives to create backend functions. They use an immutable builder pattern, which means you can create reusable base procedures that share functionality among multiple procedures.\n\nWriting procedures​\n\nThe t object you create during tRPC setup returns an initial t.procedure which all other procedures are built on:\n\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n \nconst t = initTRPC.context<{ signGuestBook: () => Promise<void> }>().create();\n \nexport const router = t.router;\nexport const publicProcedure = t.procedure;\n \nconst appRouter = router({\n  // Queries are the best place to fetch data\n  hello: publicProcedure.query(() => {\n    return {\n      message: 'hello world',\n    };\n  }),\n \n  // Mutations are the best place to do things like updating a database\n  goodbye: publicProcedure.mutation(async (opts) => {\n    await opts.ctx.signGuestBook();\n \n    return {\n      message: 'goodbye!',\n    };\n  }),\n});\nCopy\nReusable \"Base Procedures\"​\n\nAs a general pattern we recommend you rename and export t.procedure as publicProcedure, which then makes room for you to create other named procedures for specific use cases and export those too. This pattern is called \"base procedures\" and is a key pattern for code and behaviour re-use in tRPC; every application is likely to need it.\n\nIn the below code, we're using reusable base procedures to build common use-cases for our app - we're making a reusable base procedures for logged in users (authedProcedure) & another base procedure that takes an organizationId and validates that a user is part of that organization.\n\nThis is a simplified example; in practice you may want to use some combination of Headers, Context, Middleware, and Metadata, to authenticate and authorize your users.\n\nimport { initTRPC, TRPCError } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n \ntype Organization = {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n};\ntype Membership = {\n  role: 'ADMIN' | 'MEMBER';\n  Organization: Organization;\n};\ntype User = {\n  id: string;\n  memberships: Membership[];\n};\ntype Context = {\n  /**\n   * User is nullable\n   */\n  user: User | null;\n};\n \nconst t = initTRPC.context<Context>().create();\n \nexport const publicProcedure = t.procedure;\n \n// procedure that asserts that the user is logged in\nexport const authedProcedure = t.procedure.use(async function isAuthed(opts) {\n  const { ctx } = opts;\n  // `ctx.user` is nullable\n  if (!ctx.user) {\n            \n(property) user: User | null\n    throw new TRPCError({ code: 'UNAUTHORIZED' });\n  }\n \n  return opts.next({\n    ctx: {\n      // ✅ user value is known to be non-null now\n      user: ctx.user,\n    },\n  });\n});\n \n// procedure that a user is a member of a specific organization\nexport const organizationProcedure = authedProcedure\n  .input(z.object({ organizationId: z.string() }))\n  .use(function isMemberOfOrganization(opts) {\n    const membership = opts.ctx.user.memberships.find(\n      (m) => m.Organization.id === opts.input.organizationId,\n    );\n    if (!membership) {\n      throw new TRPCError({\n        code: 'FORBIDDEN',\n      });\n    }\n    return opts.next({\n      ctx: {\n        Organization: membership.Organization,\n      },\n    });\n  });\n \nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  whoami: authedProcedure.query(async (opts) => {\n    // user is non-nullable here\n    const { ctx } = opts;\n            \nconst ctx: {\n    user: User;\n}\n    return ctx.user;\n  }),\n  addMember: organizationProcedure\n    .input(\n      z.object({\n        email: z.string().email(),\n      }),\n    )\n    .mutation((opts) => {\n      // ctx contains the non-nullable user & the organization being queried\n      const { ctx } = opts;\n              \nconst ctx: {\n    user: User;\n    Organization: Organization;\n}\n \n      // input includes the validated email of the user being invited & the validated organizationId\n      const { input } = opts;\n               \nconst input: {\n    organizationId: string;\n    email: string;\n}\n \n      return '...';\n    }),\n});\nCopy\nInferring the options type of a \"Base Procedure\"​\n\nIn addition to being able to infer the input and output types of a procedure, you can also infer the options type of a specific procedure builder (or base procedure) using inferProcedureBuilderResolverOptions.\n\nThis type helper is useful for declaring a type to a function's parameters. Like for example, separating the procedure's handler (main execution code) from its definition at the router, or for creating a helper function that works with multiple procedures.\n\nasync function getMembersOfOrganization(\n  opts: inferProcedureBuilderResolverOptions<typeof organizationProcedure>,\n) {\n  // input and ctx are now correctly typed!\n  const { ctx, input } = opts;\n \n  return await prisma.user.findMany({\n    where: {\n      membership: {\n        organizationId: ctx.Organization.id,\n      },\n    },\n  });\n}\nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  listMembers: organizationProcedure.query(async (opts) => {\n    // use helper function!\n    const members = await getMembersOfOrganization(opts);\n \n    return members;\n  }),\n});\nCopy\nSubscriptions​\n\nFor information on subscriptions, see our subscriptions guide.\n\nEdit this page"

    "html": "Backend Usage\nInput & Output Validators\nVersion: 11.x\nInput & Output Validators\n\ntRPC procedures may define validation logic for their input and/or output, and validators are also used to infer the types of inputs and outputs (using the Standard Schema interface if available, or custom interfaces for supported validators if not). We have first class support for many popular validators, and you can integrate validators which we don't directly support.\n\nInput Validators​\n\nBy defining an input validator, tRPC can check that a procedure call is correct and return a validation error if not.\n\nTo set up an input validator, use the procedure.input() method:\n\n// Our examples use Zod by default, but usage with other libraries is identical\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n \nexport const t = initTRPC.create();\nconst publicProcedure = t.procedure;\n \nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  hello: publicProcedure\n    .input(\n      z.object({\n        name: z.string(),\n      }),\n    )\n    .query((opts) => {\n      const name = opts.input.name;\n             \nconst name: string\n      return {\n        greeting: `Hello ${opts.input.name}`,\n      };\n    }),\n});\nCopy\nInput Merging​\n\n.input() can be stacked to build more complex types, which is particularly useful when you want to utilise some common input to a collection of procedures in a middleware.\n\nconst baseProcedure = t.procedure\n  .input(z.object({ townName: z.string() }))\n  .use((opts) => {\n    const input = opts.input;\n           \nconst input: {\n    townName: string;\n}\n \n    console.log(`Handling request with user from: ${input.townName}`);\n \n    return opts.next();\n  });\n \nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  hello: baseProcedure\n    .input(\n      z.object({\n        name: z.string(),\n      }),\n    )\n    .query((opts) => {\n      const input = opts.input;\n             \nconst input: {\n    townName: string;\n    name: string;\n}\n      return {\n        greeting: `Hello ${input.name}, my friend from ${input.townName}`,\n      };\n    }),\n});\nCopy\nOutput Validators​\n\nValidating outputs is not always as important as defining inputs, since tRPC gives you automatic type-safety by inferring the return type of your procedures. Some reasons to define an output validator include:\n\nChecking that data returned from untrusted sources is correct\nEnsure that you are not returning more data to the client than necessary\nINFO\n\nIf output validation fails, the server will respond with an INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.\n\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n \nexport const t = initTRPC.create();\nconst publicProcedure = t.procedure;\n \nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  hello: publicProcedure\n    .output(\n      z.object({\n        greeting: z.string(),\n      }),\n    )\n    .query((opts) => {\n      return {\n        gre,\n           \ngreeting\n      };\n    }),\n});\nCopy\nOutput validation of subscriptions​\n\nSince subscriptions are async iterators, you can use the same validation techniques as above.\n\nHave a look at the subscriptions guide for more information.\n\nThe most basic validator: a function​\n\nYou can define a validator without any 3rd party dependencies, with a function.\n\nINFO\n\nWe don't recommend making a custom validator unless you have a specific need, but it's important to understand that there's no magic here - it's just typescript!\n\nIn most cases we recommend you use a validation library\n\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\n \nexport const t = initTRPC.create();\n \nconst publicProcedure = t.procedure;\n \nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  hello: publicProcedure\n    .input((value): string => {\n      if (typeof value === 'string') {\n        return value;\n      }\n      throw new Error('Input is not a string');\n    })\n    .output((value): string => {\n      if (typeof value === 'string') {\n        return value;\n      }\n      throw new Error('Output is not a string');\n    })\n    .query((opts) => {\n      const { input } = opts;\n               \nconst input: string\n      return `hello ${input}`;\n    }),\n});\n \nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\nCopy\nLibrary integrations​\n\ntRPC works out of the box with a number of popular validation and parsing libraries, including any library conforming to Standard Schema. The below are some examples of usage with validators which we officially maintain support for.\n\nWith Zod​\n\nZod is our default recommendation, it has a strong ecosystem which makes it a great choice to use in multiple parts of your codebase. If you have no opinion of your own and want a powerful library which won't limit future needs, Zod is a great choice.\n\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n \nexport const t = initTRPC.create();\n \nconst publicProcedure = t.procedure;\n \nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  hello: publicProcedure\n    .input(\n      z.object({\n        name: z.string(),\n      }),\n    )\n    .output(\n      z.object({\n        greeting: z.string(),\n      }),\n    )\n    .query(({ input }) => {\n               \n(parameter) input: {\n    name: string;\n}\n      return {\n        greeting: `hello ${input.name}`,\n      };\n    }),\n});\n \nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\nCopy\nWith Yup​\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport * as yup from 'yup';\n \nexport const t = initTRPC.create();\n \nconst publicProcedure = t.procedure;\n \nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  hello: publicProcedure\n    .input(\n      yup.object({\n        name: yup.string().required(),\n      }),\n    )\n    .output(\n      yup.object({\n        greeting: yup.string().required(),\n      }),\n    )\n    .query(({ input }) => {\n               \n(parameter) input: {\n    name: string;\n}\n      return {\n        greeting: `hello ${input.name}`,\n      };\n    }),\n});\n \nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\nCopy\nWith Superstruct​\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { object, string } from 'superstruct';\n \nexport const t = initTRPC.create();\n \nconst publicProcedure = t.procedure;\n \nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  hello: publicProcedure\n    .input(object({ name: string() }))\n    .output(object({ greeting: string() }))\n    .query(({ input }) => {\n               \n(parameter) input: {\n    name: string;\n}\n      return {\n        greeting: `hello ${input.name}`,\n      };\n    }),\n});\n \nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\nCopy\nWith scale-ts​\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport * as $ from 'scale-codec';\n \nexport const t = initTRPC.create();\n \nconst publicProcedure = t.procedure;\n \nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  hello: publicProcedure\n    .input($.object($.field('name', $.str)))\n    .output($.object($.field('greeting', $.str)))\n    .query(({ input }) => {\n               \n(parameter) input: {\n    readonly name: string;\n}\n      return {\n        greeting: `hello ${input.name}`,\n      };\n    }),\n});\n \nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\nCopy\nWith Typia​\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport typia from 'typia';\nimport { v4 } from 'uuid';\nimport { IBbsArticle } from '../structures/IBbsArticle';\nconst t = initTRPC.create();\nconst publicProcedure = t.procedure;\nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  store: publicProcedure\n    .input(typia.createAssert<IBbsArticle.IStore>())\n    .output(typia.createAssert<IBbsArticle>())\n    .query(({ input }) => {\n      return {\n        id: v4(),\n        writer: input.writer,\n        title: input.title,\n        body: input.body,\n        created_at: new Date().toString(),\n      };\n    }),\n});\nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\nCopy\nWith ArkType​\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { type } from 'arktype';\nexport const t = initTRPC.create();\nconst publicProcedure = t.procedure;\nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  hello: publicProcedure.input(type({ name: 'string' })).query((opts) => {\n    return {\n      greeting: `hello ${opts.input.name}`,\n    };\n  }),\n});\nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\nCopy\nWith effect​\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { Schema } from 'effect';\nexport const t = initTRPC.create();\nconst publicProcedure = t.procedure;\nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  hello: publicProcedure\n    .input(Schema.standardSchemaV1(Schema.Struct({ name: Schema.String })))\n    .output(Schema.standardSchemaV1(Schema.Struct({ greeting: Schema.String })))\n    .query(({ input }) => {\n      //      ^?\n      return {\n        greeting: `hello ${input.name}`,\n      };\n    }),\n});\nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\nCopy\nWith Valibot​\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport * as v from 'valibot';\n \nexport const t = initTRPC.create();\n \nconst publicProcedure = t.procedure;\n \nexport const appRouter = t.router({\n  hello: publicProcedure\n    .input(v.object({ name: v.string() }))\n    .output(v.object({ greeting: v.string() }))\n    .query(({ input }) => {\n               \n(parameter) input: {\n    name: string;\n}\n      return {\n        greeting: `hello ${input.name}`,\n      };\n    }),\n});\n \nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\nCopy\nWith @robolex/sure​\n\nYou're able to define your own Error types and error throwing function if necessary.

Read more.\n\nWe have a powerful feature called .pipe() which allows you to extend middlewares in a typesafe manner.\n\nBelow we have an example of a middleware that extends a base middleware(foo).

An example of a forbidden pipe is shown below. Here, the fooMiddleware overrides the ctx.a while barMiddleware still expects the root context from the initialization in initTRPC - so piping fooMiddleware with barMiddleware would not work, while piping barMiddleware with fooMiddleware does work.\n\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\n \nconst t = initTRPC\n  .context<{\n    a: {\n      b: 'a';\n    };\n  }>()\n  .create();\n \nconst fooMiddleware = t.middleware((opts) => {\n  const { ctx } = opts;\n  ctx.a; // 👈 fooMiddleware expects `ctx.a` to be an object\n     \n(property) a: {\n    b: \"a\";\n}\n  return opts.next({\n    ctx: {\n      a: 'a' as const, // 👈 `ctx.a` is no longer an object\n    },\n  });\n});\n \nconst barMiddleware = t.middleware((opts) => {\n  const { ctx } = opts;\n  ctx.a; // 👈 barMiddleware expects `ctx.a` to be an object\n     \n(property) a: {\n    b: \"a\";\n}\n  return opts.next({\n    ctx: {\n      foo: 'foo' as const,\n    },\n  });\n});\n \n// ❌ `ctx.a` does not overlap from `fooMiddleware` to `barMiddleware`\nfooMiddleware.unstable_pipe(barMiddleware);\n \n// ✅ `ctx.a` overlaps from `barMiddleware` and `fooMiddleware`\nbarMiddleware.unstable_pipe(fooMiddleware);\nCopy\nExperimental: standalone middlewares​\nINFO\n\nThis has been deprecated in favor of .concat()\n\ntRPC has an experimental API called experimental_standaloneMiddleware which allows you to independently define a middleware that can be used with any tRPC instance. Creating middlewares using t.middleware has the limitation that the Context type is tied to the Context type of the tRPC instance. This means that you cannot use the same middleware with multiple tRPC instances that have different Context types.\n\nUsing experimental_standaloneMiddleware you can create a middleware that explicitly defines its requirements, i.e. the Context, Input and Meta types:\n\nimport {\n  experimental_standaloneMiddleware,\n  initTRPC,\n  TRPCError,\n} from '@trpc/server';\nimport * as z from 'zod';\n \nconst projectAccessMiddleware = experimental_standaloneMiddleware<{\n  ctx: { allowedProjects: string[] }; // defaults to 'object' if not defined\n  input: { projectId: string }; // defaults to 'unknown' if not defined\n  // 'meta', not defined here, defaults to 'object | undefined'\n}>().create((opts) => {\n  if (!opts.ctx.allowedProjects.includes(opts.input.projectId)) {\n    throw new TRPCError({\n      code: 'FORBIDDEN',\n      message: 'Not allowed',\n    });\n  }\n \n  return opts.next();\n});\n \nconst t1 = initTRPC\n  .context<{\n    allowedProjects: string[];\n  }>()\n  .create();\n \n// ✅ `ctx.allowedProjects` satisfies \"string[]\" and `input.projectId` satisfies \"string\"\nconst accessControlledProcedure = t1.procedure\n  .input(z.object({ projectId: z.string() }))\n  .use(projectAccessMiddleware);\n \n// ❌ `ctx.allowedProjects` satisfies \"string[]\" but `input.projectId` does not satisfy \"string\"\nconst accessControlledProcedure2 = t1.procedure\n  .input(z.object({ projectId: z.number() }))\n  .use(projectAccessMiddleware);\n \n// ❌ `ctx.allowedProjects` does not satisfy \"string[]\" even though `input.projectId` satisfies \"string\"\nconst t2 = initTRPC\n  .context<{\n    allowedProjects: number[];\n  }>()\n  .create();\n \nconst accessControlledProcedure3 = t2.procedure\n  .input(z.object({ projectId: z.string() }))\n  .use(projectAccessMiddleware);\nCopy\n\nHere is an example with multiple standalone middlewares:\n\nimport { experimental_standaloneMiddleware, initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport * as z from 'zod';\n \nconst t = initTRPC.create();\nconst schemaA = z.object({ valueA: z.string() });\nconst schemaB = z.object({ valueB: z.string() });\n \nconst valueAUppercaserMiddleware = experimental_standaloneMiddleware<{\n  input: z.infer<typeof schemaA>;\n}>().create((opts) => {\n  return opts.next({\n    ctx: { valueAUppercase: opts.input.valueA.toUpperCase() },\n  });\n});\n \nconst valueBUppercaserMiddleware = experimental_standaloneMiddleware<{\n  input: z.infer<typeof schemaB>;\n}>().create((opts) => {\n  return opts.next({\n    ctx: { valueBUppercase: opts.input.valueB.toUpperCase() },\n  });\n});\n \nconst combinedInputThatSatisfiesBothMiddlewares = z.object({\n  valueA: z.string(),\n  valueB: z.string(),\n  extraProp: z.string(),\n});\n \nt.procedure\n  .input(combinedInputThatSatisfiesBothMiddlewares)\n  .use(valueAUppercaserMiddleware)\n  .use(valueBUppercaserMiddleware)\n  .query(\n    ({\n      input: { valueA, valueB, extraProp },\n      ctx: { valueAUppercase, valueBUppercase },\n    }) =>\n      `valueA: ${valueA}, valueB: ${valueB}, extraProp: ${extraProp}, valueAUppercase: ${valueAUppercase}, valueBUppercase: ${valueBUppercase}`,\n  );\nCopy\nEdit this page"

You first call createCallerFactory with an argument of the router you want to call, then this returns a function where you can pass in a Context for the following procedure calls.\n\nBasic example​\n\nWe create the router with a query to list posts and a mutation to add posts, and then we a call each method.\n\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n \ntype Context = {\n  foo: string;\n};\n \nconst t = initTRPC.context<Context>().create();\n \nconst publicProcedure = t.procedure;\nconst { createCallerFactory, router } = t;\n \ninterface Post {\n  id: string;\n  title: string;\n}\nconst posts: Post[] = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    title: 'Hello world',\n  },\n];\nconst appRouter = router({\n  post: router({\n    add: publicProcedure\n      .input(\n        z.object({\n          title: z.string().min(2),\n        }),\n      )\n      .mutation((opts) => {\n        const post: Post = {\n          ...opts.input,\n          id: `${Math.random()}`,\n        };\n        posts.push(post);\n        return post;\n      }),\n    list: publicProcedure.query(() => posts),\n  }),\n});\n \n// 1. create a caller-function for your router\nconst createCaller = createCallerFactory(appRouter);\n \n// 2. create a caller using your `Context`\nconst caller = createCaller({\n  foo: 'bar',\n});\n \n// 3. use the caller to add and list posts\nconst addedPost = await caller.post.add({\n  title: 'How to make server-side call in tRPC',\n});\n \nconst postList = await caller.post.list();\n         \nconst postList: Post[]\nCopy\nExample usage in an integration test​\n\nTaken from https://github.com/trpc/examples-next-prisma-starter/blob/main/src/server/routers/post.test.ts\n\nimport { inferProcedureInput } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { createContextInner } from '../context';\nimport { AppRouter, createCaller } from './_app';\ntest('add and get post', async () => {\n  const ctx = await createContextInner({});\n  const caller = createCaller(ctx);\n  const input: inferProcedureInput<AppRouter['post']['add']> = {\n    text: 'hello test',\n    title: 'hello test',\n  };\n  const post = await caller.post.add(input);\n  const byId = await caller.post.byId({ id: post.id });\n  expect(byId).toMatchObject(input);\n});\nCopy\nrouter.createCaller()​\n\nWith the router.createCaller({}) function (first argument is Context) we retrieve an instance of RouterCaller.\n\nInput query example​\n\nWe create the router with an input query, and then we call the asynchronous greeting procedure to get the result.\n\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n \nconst t = initTRPC.create();\n \nconst router = t.router({\n  // Create procedure at path 'greeting'\n  greeting: t.procedure\n    .input(z.object({ name: z.string() }))\n    .query((opts) => `Hello ${opts.input.name}`),\n});\n \nconst caller = router.createCaller({});\nconst result = await caller.greeting({ name: 'tRPC' });\n        \nconst result: string\nCopy\nMutation example​\n\nWe create the router with a mutation, and then we call the asynchronous post procedure to get the result.\n\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n \nconst posts = ['One', 'Two', 'Three'];\n \nconst t = initTRPC.create();\nconst router = t.router({\n  post: t.router({\n    add: t.procedure.input(z.string()).mutation((opts) => {\n      posts.push(opts.input);\n      return posts;\n    }),\n  }),\n});\n \nconst caller = router.createCaller({});\nconst result = await caller.post.add('Four');\n        \nconst result: string[]\nCopy\nContext with middleware example​\n\nWe create a middleware to check the context before executing the secret procedure. Below are two examples: the former fails because the context doesn't fit the middleware logic, and the latter works correctly.\n\n\n\nINFO\n\nMiddlewares are performed before any procedure(s) are called.\n\n\n\nimport { initTRPC, TRPCError } from '@trpc/server';\n \ntype Context = {\n  user?: {\n    id: string;\n  };\n};\nconst t = initTRPC.context<Context>().create();\n \nconst protectedProcedure = t.procedure.use((opts) => {\n  const { ctx } = opts;\n  if (!ctx.user) {\n    throw new TRPCError({\n      code: 'UNAUTHORIZED',\n      message: 'You are not authorized',\n    });\n  }\n \n  return opts.next({\n    ctx: {\n      // Infers that the `user` is non-nullable\n      user: ctx.user,\n    },\n  });\n});\n \nconst router = t.router({\n  secret: protectedProcedure.query((opts) => opts.ctx.user),\n});\n \n{\n  // ❌ this will return an error because there isn't the right context param\n  const caller = router.createCaller({});\n \n  const result = await caller.secret();\n}\n \n{\n  // ✅ this will work because user property is present inside context param\n  const authorizedCaller = router.createCaller({\n    user: {\n      id: 'KATT',\n    },\n  });\n  const result = await authorizedCaller.secret();\n          \nconst result: {\n    id: string;\n}\n}\nCopy\nExample for a Next.js API endpoint​\nTIP\n\nThis example shows how to use the caller in a Next.js API endpoint. tRPC creates API endpoints for you already, so this file is only meant to show how to call a procedure from another, custom endpoint.\n\nimport { TRPCError } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { getHTTPStatusCodeFromError } from '@trpc/server/http';\nimport { appRouter } from '~/server/routers/_app';\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';\n \ntype ResponseData = {\n  data?: {\n    postTitle: string;\n  };\n  error?: {\n    message: string;\n  };\n};\n \nexport default async (\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse<ResponseData>,\n) => {\n  /** We want to simulate an error, so we pick a post ID that does not exist in the database. */\n  const postId = `this-id-does-not-exist-${Math.random()}`;\n \n  const caller = appRouter.createCaller({});\n \n  try {\n    // the server-side call\n    const postResult = await caller.post.byId({ id: postId });\n \n    res.status(200).json({ data: { postTitle: postResult.title } });\n  } catch (cause) {\n    // If this a tRPC error, we can extract additional information.\n    if (cause instanceof TRPCError) {\n      // We can get the specific HTTP status code coming from tRPC (e.g. 404 for `NOT_FOUND`).\n      const httpStatusCode = getHTTPStatusCodeFromError(cause);\n \n      res.status(httpStatusCode).json({ error: { message: cause.message } });\n      return;\n    }\n \n    // This is not a tRPC error, so we don't have specific information.\n    res.status(500).json({\n      error: { message: `Error while accessing post with ID ${postId}` },\n    });\n  }\n};\nCopy\nError handling​\n\nThe createFactoryCaller and the createCaller function can take an error handler through the onError option. This can be used to throw errors that are not wrapped in a TRPCError, or respond to errors in some other way. Any handler passed to createCallerFactory will be called before the handler passed to createCaller. The handler is called with the same arguments as an error formatter would be, except for the shape field:\n\n{\n  ctx: unknown; // The request context\n  error: TRPCError; // The TRPCError that was thrown\n  path: string | undefined; // The path of the procedure that threw the error\n  input: unknown; // The input that was passed to the procedure\n  type: 'query' | 'mutation' | 'subscription' | 'unknown'; // The type of the procedure that threw the error\n}\nCopy\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n \nconst t = initTRPC\n  .context<{\n    foo?: 'bar';\n  }>()\n  .create();\n \nconst router = t.router({\n  greeting: t.procedure.input(z.object({ name: z.string() })).query((opts) => {\n    if (opts.input.name === 'invalid') {\n      throw new Error('Invalid name');\n    }\n \n    return `Hello ${opts.input.name}`;\n  }),\n});\n \nconst caller = router.createCaller(\n  {\n    /* context */\n  },\n  {\n    onError: (opts) => {\n      console.error('An error occurred:', opts.error);\n    },\n  },\n);\n \n// The following will log \"An error occurred: Error: Invalid name\", and then throw a plain error\n//  with the message \"This is a custom error\"\nawait caller.greeting({ name: 'invalid' });\nCopy\nEdit this page"

    "html": "Backend Usage\nSubscriptions\nVersion: 11.x\nSubscriptions\nIntroduction​\n\nSubscriptions are a type of real-time event stream between the client and server. Use subscriptions when you need to push real-time updates to the client.\n\nWith tRPC's subscriptions, the client establishes and maintains a persistent connection to the server plus automatically attempts to reconnect and recover gracefully if disconnected with the help of tracked() events.\n\nWebSockets or Server-sent Events?​\n\nYou can either use WebSockets or Server-sent Events (SSE) to setup real-time subscriptions in tRPC.\n\nFor WebSockets, see the WebSockets page\nFor SSE, see the httpSubscriptionLink\n\nIf you are unsure which one to use, we recommend using SSE for subscriptions as it's easier to setup and don't require setting up a WebSocket server.\n\nReference projects​\nType\tExample Type\tLink\nWebSockets\tBare-minimum Node.js WebSockets example\t/examples/standalone-server\nSSE\tFull-stack SSE implementation\tgithub.com/trpc/examples-next-sse-chat\nWebSockets\tFull-stack WebSockets implementation\tgithub.com/trpc/examples-next-prisma-websockets-starter\nBasic example​\nTIP\n\nFor a full example, see our full-stack SSE example.\n\nserver.ts\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nconst t = initTRPC.create();\nconst ee = new EventEmitter();\nexport const appRouter = router({\n  onPostAdd: publicProcedure.subscription(async function* (opts) {\n    // listen for new events\n    for await (const [data] of on(ee, 'add', {\n      // Passing the AbortSignal from the request automatically cancels the event emitter when the request is aborted\n      signal: opts.signal,\n    })) {\n      const post = data as Post;\n      yield post;\n    }\n  }),\n});\nCopy\nAutomatic tracking of id using tracked() (recommended)​\n\nIf you yield an event using our tracked()-helper and include an id, the client will automatically reconnect when it gets disconnected and send the last known ID.\n\nYou can send an initial lastEventId when initializing the subscription and it will be automatically updated as the browser receives data.\n\nFor SSE, this is part of the EventSource-spec and will be propagated through lastEventId in your .input().\nFor WebSockets, our wsLink will automatically send the last known ID and update it as the browser receives data.\nTIP\n\nIf you're fetching data based on the lastEventId, and capturing all events is critical, make sure you setup the event listener before fetching events from your database as is done in our full-stack SSE example, this can prevent newly emitted events being ignored while yield'ing the original batch based on lastEventId.\n\nimport EventEmitter, { on } from 'events';\nimport type { Post } from '@prisma/client';\nimport { tracked } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\nimport { publicProcedure, router } from '../trpc';\nconst ee = new EventEmitter();\nexport const subRouter = router({\n  onPostAdd: publicProcedure\n    .input(\n      z\n        .object({\n          // lastEventId is the last event id that the client has received\n          // On the first call, it will be whatever was passed in the initial setup\n          // If the client reconnects, it will be the last event id that the client received\n          lastEventId: z.string().nullish(),\n        })\n        .optional(),\n    )\n    .subscription(async function* (opts) {\n      // We start by subscribing to the ee so that we don't miss any new events while fetching\n      const iterable = ee.toIterable('add', {\n        // Passing the AbortSignal from the request automatically cancels the event emitter when the request is aborted\n        signal: opts.signal,\n      });\n      if (opts.input.lastEventId) {\n        // [...] get the posts since the last event id and yield them\n        // const items = await db.post.findMany({ ... })\n        // for (const item of items) {\n        //   yield tracked(item.id, item);\n        // }\n      }\n      // listen for new events\n      for await (const [data] of on(ee, 'add', {\n        signal: opts.signal,\n      })) {\n        const post = data as Post;\n        // tracking the post id ensures the client can reconnect at any time and get the latest events this id\n        yield tracked(post.id, post);\n      }\n    }),\n});\nCopy\nPull data in a loop​\n\nThis recipe is useful when you want to periodically check for new data from a source like a database and push it to the client.\n\nserver.ts\nimport type { Post } from '@prisma/client';\nimport { tracked } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\nimport { publicProcedure, router } from '../trpc';\nexport const subRouter = router({\n  onPostAdd: publicProcedure\n    .input(\n      z.object({\n        // lastEventId is the last event id that the client has received\n        // On the first call, it will be whatever was passed in the initial setup\n        // If the client reconnects, it will be the last event id that the client received\n        // The id is the createdAt of the post\n        lastEventId: z.coerce.date().nullish(),\n      }),\n    )\n    .subscription(async function* (opts) {\n      // `opts.signal` is an AbortSignal that will be aborted when the client disconnects.\n      let lastEventId = opts.input?.lastEventId ?? null;\n      // We use a `while` loop that checks `!opts.signal.aborted`\n      while (!opts.signal!.aborted) {\n        const posts = await db.post.findMany({\n          // If we have a `lastEventId`, we only fetch posts created after it.\n          where: lastEventId\n            ? {\n                createdAt: {\n                  gt: lastEventId,\n                },\n              }\n            : undefined,\n          orderBy: {\n            createdAt: 'asc',\n          },\n        });\n        for (const post of posts) {\n          // `tracked` is a helper that sends an `id` with each event.\n          // This allows the client to resume from the last received event upon reconnection.\n          yield tracked(post.createdAt.toJSON(), post);\n          lastEventId = post.createdAt;\n        }\n        // Wait for a bit before polling again to avoid hammering the database.\n        await sleep(1_000);\n      }\n    }),\n});\nCopy\nStopping a subscription from the server​\n\nIf you need to stop a subscription from the server, simply return in the generator function.\n\nimport { publicProcedure, router } from '../trpc';\nexport const subRouter = router({\n  onPostAdd: publicProcedure\n    .input(\n      z.object({\n        lastEventId: z.string().coerce.number().min(0).optional(),\n      }),\n    )\n    .subscription(async function* (opts) {\n      let index = opts.input.lastEventId ?? 0;\n      while (!opts.signal!.aborted) {\n        const idx = index++;\n        if (idx > 100) {\n          // With this, the subscription will stop and the client will disconnect\n          return;\n        }\n        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10));\n      }\n    }\n  }),\n});\nCopy\n\nOn the client, you just .unsubscribe() the subscription.\n\nCleanup of side effects​\n\nIf you need to clean up any side-effects of your subscription you can use the try...finally pattern, as trpc invokes the .return() of the Generator Instance when the subscription stops for any reason.\n\nimport EventEmitter, { on } from 'events';\nimport type { Post } from '@prisma/client';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\nimport { publicProcedure, router } from '../trpc';\nconst ee = new EventEmitter();\nexport const subRouter = router({\n  onPostAdd: publicProcedure.subscription(async function* (opts) {\n    let timeout;\n    try {\n      for await (const [data] of on(ee, 'add', {\n        signal: opts.signal,\n      })) {\n        timeout = setTimeout(() => console.log('Pretend like this is useful'));\n        const post = data as Post;\n        yield post;\n      }\n    } finally {\n      if (timeout) clearTimeout(timeout);\n    }\n  }),\n});\nCopy\nError handling​\n\nThrowing an error in a generator function propagates to trpc's onError() on the backend.\n\nIf the error thrown is a 5xx error, the client will automatically attempt to reconnect based on the last event id that is tracked using tracked(). For other errors, the subscription will be cancelled and propagate to the onError() callback.\n\nOutput validation​\n\nSince subscriptions are async iterators, you have to go through the iterator to validate the output.\n\nExample with zod​\nzAsyncIterable.ts\nimport type { TrackedEnvelope } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { isTrackedEnvelope, tracked } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\nfunction isAsyncIterable<TValue, TReturn = unknown>(\n  value: unknown,\n): value is AsyncIterable<TValue, TReturn> {\n  return !!value && typeof value === 'object' && Symbol.asyncIterator in value;\n}\nconst trackedEnvelopeSchema =\n  z.custom<TrackedEnvelope<unknown>>(isTrackedEnvelope);\n/**\n * A Zod schema helper designed specifically for validating async iterables. This schema ensures that:\n * 1. The value being validated is an async iterable.\n * 2. Each item yielded by the async iterable conforms to a specified type.\n * 3. The return value of the async iterable, if any, also conforms to a specified type.\n */\nexport function zAsyncIterable<\n  TYieldIn,\n  TYieldOut,\n  TReturnIn = void,\n  TReturnOut = void,\n  Tracked extends boolean = false,\n>(opts: {\n  /**\n   * Validate the value yielded by the async generator\n   */\n  yield: z.ZodType<TYieldIn, any, TYieldOut>;\n  /**\n   * Validate the return value of the async generator\n   * @remark not applicable for subscriptions\n   */\n  return?: z.ZodType<TReturnIn, any, TReturnOut>;\n  /**\n   * Whether if the yielded values are tracked\n   * @remark only applicable for subscriptions\n   */\n  tracked?: Tracked;\n}) {\n  return z\n    .custom<\n      AsyncIterable<\n        Tracked extends true ? TrackedEnvelope<TYieldIn> : TYieldIn,\n        TReturnIn\n      >\n    >((val) => isAsyncIterable(val))\n    .transform(async function* (iter) {\n      const iterator = iter[Symbol.asyncIterator]();\n      try {\n        let next;\n        while ((next = await iterator.next()) && !next.done) {\n          if (opts.tracked) {\n            const [id, data] = trackedEnvelopeSchema.parse(next.value);\n            yield tracked(id, await opts.yield.parseAsync(data));\n            continue;\n          }\n          yield opts.yield.parseAsync(next.value);\n        }\n        if (opts.return) {\n          return await opts.return.parseAsync(next.value);\n        }\n        return;\n      } finally {\n        await iterator.return?.();\n      }\n    }) as z.ZodType<\n    AsyncIterable<\n      Tracked extends true ? TrackedEnvelope<TYieldIn> : TYieldIn,\n      TReturnIn,\n      unknown\n    >,\n    any,\n    AsyncIterable<\n      Tracked extends true ? TrackedEnvelope<TYieldOut> : TYieldOut,\n      TReturnOut,\n      unknown\n    >\n  >;\n}\nCopy\n\nNow you can use this helper to validate the output of your subscription procedures:\n\n_app.ts\nimport { publicProcedure, router } from '../trpc';\nimport { zAsyncIterable } from './zAsyncIterable';\nexport const appRouter = router({\n  mySubscription: publicProcedure\n    .input(\n      z.object({\n        lastEventId: z.coerce.number().min(0).optional(),\n      }),\n    )\n    .output(\n      zAsyncIterable({\n        yield: z.object({\n          count: z.number(),\n        }),\n        tracked: true,\n      }),\n    )\n    .subscription(async function* (opts) {\n      let index = opts.input.lastEventId ?? 0;\n      while (true) {\n        index++;\n        yield tracked(index, {\n          count: index,\n        });\n        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));\n      }\n    }),\n});\nCopy\nEdit this page"

Create a tRPC router​\n\nInitialize your tRPC backend in src/server/trpc.ts using the initTRPC function, and create your first router. We're going to make a simple \"hello world\" router and procedure here - but for deeper information on creating your tRPC API you should refer to:\n\nthe Quickstart guide and Backend usage docs for tRPC information\nthe Next.js Adapter docs for mounting tRPC within your Next.js server.\nView sample backend\nNOTE\n\nThe backend above is using the recommended file structure, but you can keep it simple and put everything in an API handler directly if you prefer.\n\n4. Create tRPC hooks​\n\nuse the createTRPCNext function to create a set of strongly-typed hooks from your API's type signature.\n\nutils/trpc.ts\nimport { httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client';\nimport { createTRPCNext } from '@trpc/next';\nimport type { AppRouter } from '../server/routers/_app';\nfunction getBaseUrl() {\n  if (typeof window !== 'undefined')\n    // browser should use relative path\n    return '';\n  if (process.env.VERCEL_URL)\n    // reference for vercel.com\n    return `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`;\n  if (process.env.RENDER_INTERNAL_HOSTNAME)\n    // reference for render.com\n    return `http://${process.env.RENDER_INTERNAL_HOSTNAME}:${process.env.PORT}`;\n  // assume localhost\n  return `http://localhost:${process.env.PORT ?? 3000}`;\n}\nexport const trpc = createTRPCNext<AppRouter>({\n  config(config) {\n    return {\n      links: [\n        httpBatchLink({\n          /**\n           * If you want to use SSR, you need to use the server's full URL\n           * @see https://trpc.io/docs/v11/ssr\n           **/\n          url: `${getBaseUrl()}/api/trpc`,\n          // You can pass any HTTP headers you wish here\n          async headers() {\n            return {\n              // authorization: getAuthCookie(),\n            };\n          },\n        }),\n      ],\n    };\n  },\n  /**\n   * @see https://trpc.io/docs/v11/ssr\n   **/\n  ssr: false,\n});\nCopy\nNOTE\n\ncreateTRPCNext does not work with the tRPC-v9 interop mode. If you are migrating from v9 using interop, you should continue using the old way of initializing tRPC.\n\n5. Configure _app.tsx​\n\nWrap your root app page in the trpc.withTRPC HOC, similar to this:\n\npages/_app.tsx\nimport type { AppType } from 'next/app';\nimport { trpc } from '../utils/trpc';\nconst MyApp: AppType = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />;\n};\nexport default trpc.withTRPC(MyApp);\nCopy\n6. Make an API request​\n\nYou're all set!\n\nYou can now use the React hooks you have just created to invoke your API. For more detail see the React Query Integration\n\npages/index.tsx\nimport { trpc } from '../utils/trpc';\nexport default function IndexPage() {\n  const hello = trpc.hello.useQuery({ text: 'client' });\n  if (!hello.data) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>;\n  }\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>{hello.data.greeting}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nCopy\ncreateTRPCNext() options​\nconfig-callback​\n\nThe config-argument is a function that returns an object that configures the tRPC and React Query clients. This function has a ctx input that gives you access to the Next.js req object, among other things. The returned value can contain the following properties:\n\nRequired:\nlinks to customize the flow of data between tRPC Client and the tRPC Server. Read more.\nOptional:\nqueryClientConfig: a configuration object for the React Query QueryClient used internally by the tRPC React hooks: QueryClient docs\nqueryClient: a React Query QueryClient instance\nNote: You can only provide either a queryClient or a queryClientConfig.\ntransformer: a transformer applied to outgoing payloads.

This callback can return a boolean, or a Promise resolving to a boolean:\n\nutils/trpc.ts\nimport { httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client';\nimport { createTRPCNext } from '@trpc/next';\nimport superjson from 'superjson';\nimport type { AppRouter } from './api/trpc/[trpc]';\nexport const trpc = createTRPCNext<AppRouter>({\n  config(config) {\n    const { ctx } = opts;\n    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n      // during client requests\n      return {\n        links: [\n          httpBatchLink({\n            url: '/api/trpc',\n          }),\n        ],\n      };\n    }\n    return {\n      links: [\n        httpBatchLink({\n          // The server needs to know your app's full url\n          url: `${getBaseUrl()}/api/trpc`,\n          /**\n           * Set custom request headers on every request from tRPC\n           * @see https://trpc.io/docs/v10/header\n           */\n          headers() {\n            if (!ctx?.req?.headers) {\n              return {};\n            }\n            // To use SSR properly, you need to forward client headers to the server\n            // This is so you can pass through things like cookies when we're server-side rendering\n            return {\n              cookie: ctx.req.headers.cookie,\n            };\n          },\n        }),\n      ],\n    };\n  },\n  ssr(opts) {\n    // only SSR if the request is coming from a bot\n    return opts.ctx?.req?.headers['user-agent']?.includes('bot');\n  },\n});\nCopy\npages/_app.tsx\nimport { trpc } from '~/utils/trpc';\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app';\nimport React from 'react';\nconst MyApp: AppType = ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) => {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />;\n};\nexport default trpc.withTRPC(MyApp);\nCopy\nFAQ​\nQ: Why do I need to forward the client's headers to the server manually? Why doesn't tRPC automatically do that for me?​\n\nWhile it's rare that you wouldn't want to forward the client's headers to the server when doing SSR, you might want to add things dynamically in the headers. Therefore, tRPC doesn't want to take responsibility for header keys colliding, etc.\n\nQ: Why do I need to delete the connection header when using SSR on Node 18?​\n\nIf you don't remove the connection header, the data fetching will fail with TRPCClientError: fetch failed because connection is a forbidden header name.\n\nQ: Why do I still see network requests being made in the Network tab?​\n\nBy default, @tanstack/react-query (which we use for the data fetching hooks) refetches data on mount and window refocus, even if it's already got initial data via SSR. This ensures data is always up-to-date. See the page on SSG if you'd like to disable this behavior.\n\nEdit this page"

    "html": "Client Usage\nNext.js Integration\nServer-Side Helpers\nVersion: 11.x\nServer-Side Helpers\n\nThe server-side helpers provides you with a set of helper functions that you can use to prefetch queries on the server. This is useful for SSG, but also for SSR if you opt not to use ssr: true.\n\nPrefetching via the server-side helpers allows populating the query cache on the server, which means that these queries do not have to fetch on the client initially.\n\nThere are 2 ways to use the server-side helpers.​\n1. Internal router​\n\nThis method is used when you have direct access to your tRPC router. e.g. when developing a monolithic Next.js application.\n\nUsing the helpers makes tRPC call your procedures directly on the server, without an HTTP request, similar to server-side calls. That also means that you don't have the request and response at hand like you usually do. Make sure you're instantiating the server-side helpers with a context without req & res, which are typically filled via the context creation. We recommend the concept of \"inner\" and \"outer\" context in that scenario.\n\nimport { createServerSideHelpers } from '@trpc/react-query/server';\nimport { createContext } from '~/server/context';\nimport superjson from 'superjson';\nconst helpers = createServerSideHelpers({\n  router: appRouter,\n  ctx: await createContext(),\n  transformer: superjson, // optional - adds superjson serialization\n});\nCopy\n2. External router​\n\nThis method is used when you don't have direct access to your tRPC router. e.g. when developing a Next.js application and a standalone API hosted separately.\n\nimport { createTRPCClient } from '@trpc/client';\nimport { createServerSideHelpers } from '@trpc/react-query/server';\nimport superjson from 'superjson';\nconst proxyClient = createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({\n  links: [\n    httpBatchLink({\n      url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/trpc',\n    }),\n  ],\n});\nconst helpers = createServerSideHelpers({\n  client: proxyClient,\n});\nCopy\nHelpers usage​\n\nThe server-side helpers methods return an object much like the tRPC client, with all of your routers as keys. However, rather than useQuery and useMutation, you get prefetch, fetch, prefetchInfinite, and fetchInfinite functions.\n\nThe primary difference between prefetch and fetch is that fetch acts much like a normal function call, returning the result of the query, whereas prefetch does not return the result and never throws - if you need that behavior, use fetch instead. Instead, prefetch will add the query to the cache, which you then dehydrate and send to the client.\n\nreturn {\n  props: {\n    // very important - use `trpcState` as the key\n    trpcState: helpers.dehydrate(),\n  },\n};\nCopy\n\nThe rule of thumb is prefetch for queries that you know you'll need on the client, and fetch for queries that you want to use the result of on the server.\n\nThe functions are all wrappers around react-query functions. Please check out their docs to learn more about them in detail.\n\nINFO\n\nFor a full example, see our E2E SSG test example\n\nNext.js Example​\npages/posts/[id].tsx\nimport { createServerSideHelpers } from '@trpc/react-query/server';\nimport { appRouter } from '~/server/routers/_app';\nimport { trpc } from '~/utils/trpc';\nimport { GetServerSidePropsContext, InferGetServerSidePropsType } from 'next';\nimport superjson from 'superjson';\nexport async function getServerSideProps(\n  context: GetServerSidePropsContext<{ id: string }>,\n) {\n  const helpers = createServerSideHelpers({\n    router: appRouter,\n    ctx: {},\n    transformer: superjson,\n  });\n  const id = context.params?.id as string;\n  /*\n   * Prefetching the `post.byId` query.\n   * `prefetch` does not return the result and never throws - if you need that behavior, use `fetch` instead.\n   */\n  await helpers.post.byId.prefetch({ id });\n  // Make sure to return { props: { trpcState: helpers.dehydrate() } }\n  return {\n    props: {\n      trpcState: helpers.dehydrate(),\n      id,\n    },\n  };\n}\nexport default function PostViewPage(\n  props: InferGetServerSidePropsType<typeof getServerSideProps>,\n) {\n  const { id } = props;\n  const postQuery = trpc.post.byId.useQuery({ id });\n  if (postQuery.status !== 'success') {\n    // won't happen since the query has been prefetched\n    return <>Loading...</>;\n  }\n  const { data } = postQuery;\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{data.title}</h1>\n      <em>Created {data.createdAt.toLocaleDateString()}</em>\n      <p>{data.text}</p>\n      <h2>Raw data:</h2>\n      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 4)}</pre>\n    </>\n  );\n}\nCopy\nEdit this page"

    "html": "Client Usage\nLinks\nVersion: 11.x\nLinks Overview\n\nLinks enable you to customize the flow of data between the tRPC Client and Server. A link should do only one thing, which can be either a self-contained modification to a tRPC operation (query, mutation, or subscription) or a side-effect based on the operation (such as logging).\n\nYou can compose links together into an array that you can provide to the tRPC client configuration via the links property, which represents a link chain. This means that the tRPC client will execute the links in the order they are added to the links array when doing a request and will execute them again in reverse when it's handling a response. Here's a visual representation of the link chain:\n\ntRPC Link Diagram. Based on Apollo's.\nNOTE\n\nThe below examples are assuming you use Next.js, but the same as below can be added if you use the vanilla tRPC client\n\nutils/trpc.ts\nimport { httpBatchLink, loggerLink } from '@trpc/client';\nimport { createTRPCNext } from '@trpc/next';\nexport default createTRPCNext<AppRouter>({\n  config() {\n    const url = `http://localhost:3000`;\n    return {\n      links: [\n        loggerLink(),\n        httpBatchLink({\n          url,\n        }),\n      ],\n    };\n  },\n});\nCopy\nCreating a custom link​\n\nA link is a function that follows the TRPCLink type. Each link is composed of three parts:\n\nThe link returns a function that has a parameter with the TRPCClientRuntime type. This argument is passed by tRPC and it is used when creating a terminating link. If you're not creating a terminating link, you can just create a function that has no parameters. In such case, the link should be added to the links array without invoking (links: [..., myLink, httpBatchLink(...)]).\nThe function in step 1 returns another function that receives an object with two properties: op which is the Operation that is being executed by the client, and next which is the function we use to call the next link down the chain.\nThe function in step 2 returns a final function that returns the observable function provided by @trpc/server. The observable accepts a function that receives an observer which helps our link notify the next link up the chain how they should handle the operation result. In this function, we can just return next(op) and leave it as is, or we can subscribe to next, which enables our link to handle the operation result.\nExample​\nutils/customLink.ts\nimport { TRPCLink } from '@trpc/client';\nimport { observable } from '@trpc/server/observable';\nimport type { AppRouter } from '~/server/routers/_app';\nexport const customLink: TRPCLink<AppRouter> = () => {\n  // here we just got initialized in the app - this happens once per app\n  // useful for storing cache for instance\n  return ({ next, op }) => {\n    // this is when passing the result to the next link\n    // each link needs to return an observable which propagates results\n    return observable((observer) => {\n      console.log('performing operation:', op);\n      const unsubscribe = next(op).subscribe({\n        next(value) {\n          console.log('we received value', value);\n          observer.next(value);\n        },\n        error(err) {\n          console.log('we received error', err);\n          observer.error(err);\n        },\n        complete() {\n          observer.complete();\n        },\n      });\n      return unsubscribe;\n    });\n  };\n};\nCopy\nReferences​\n\nIf you need a more real reference for creating your custom link, you can check out some of the built-in links tRPC provides on GitHub.\n\nThe terminating link​\n\nThe terminating link is the last link in a link chain. Instead of calling the next function, the terminating link is responsible for sending your composed tRPC operation to the tRPC server and returning an OperationResultEnvelope.\n\nThe links array that you add to the tRPC client config should have at least one link, and that link should be a terminating link. If links don't have a terminating link at the end of them, the tRPC operation will not be sent to the tRPC server.\n\nhttpBatchLink is the recommended terminating link by tRPC.\n\nhttpLink, wsLink, and localLink are other examples of terminating links.\n\nManaging context​\n\nAs an operation moves along your link chain, it maintains a context that each link can read and modify. This allows links to pass metadata along the chain that other links use in their execution logic.\n\nObtain the current context object and modify it by accessing op.context.\n\nYou can set the context object's initial value for a particular operation by providing the context parameter to the query or useQuery hook (or mutation, subscription, etc.).\n\nFor an example use case, see Disable batching for certain requests.\n\nEdit this page"

It's ideal for local development, and for server-based production environments. In essence it's just a wrapper around the standard Node.js HTTP Server with the normal options related to tRPC.\n\nIf you have an existing API deployment like Express, Fastify, or Next.js, which you want to integrate tRPC into, you should have a look at their respective adapters. Likewise if you have a preference to host on serverless or edge compute, we have adapters like AWS Lambda and Fetch which may fit your needs.\n\nIt's also not uncommon, where the deployed adapter is hard to run on local machines, to have 2 entry-points in your application. You could use the Standalone Adapter for local development, and a different adapter when deployed.\n\nExample app​\nDescription\tLinks\nStandalone tRPC Server\t\nStackBlitz\nSource\n\nStandalone tRPC Server with CORS handling\t\nStackBlitz\nSource\nSetting up a Standalone tRPC Server​\n1.

Both the true and false branches are required. You can provide just one link, or multiple links per branch via an array.\n\nIt's important to note that when you provide links for splitLink to execute, splitLink will create an entirely new link chain based on the links you passed. Therefore, you need to use a terminating link if you only provide one link or add the terminating link at the end of the array if you provide multiple links to be executed on a branch.

For general usage of subscriptions, see our subscriptions guide.\n\nHeaders and authorization / authentication​\nWeb apps​\nSame domain​\n\nIf you're doing a web application, cookies are sent as part of the request as long as your client is on the same domain as the server.\n\nCross-domain​\n\nIf the client and server are not on the same domain, you can use withCredentials: true (read more on MDN here).\n\nExample:\n\n// [...]\nhttpSubscriptionLink({\n  url: 'https://example.com/api/trpc',\n  eventSourceOptions() {\n    return {\n      withCredentials: true, // <---\n    };\n  },\n});\nCopy\nCustom headers through ponyfill​\n\nRecommended for non-web environments\n\nYou can ponyfill EventSource and use the eventSourceOptions -callback to populate headers.\n\nimport {\n  createTRPCClient,\n  httpBatchLink,\n  httpSubscriptionLink,\n  splitLink,\n} from '@trpc/client';\nimport { EventSourcePolyfill } from 'event-source-polyfill';\nimport type { AppRouter } from '../server/index.js';\n// Initialize the tRPC client\nconst trpc = createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({\n  links: [\n    splitLink({\n      condition: (op) => op.type === 'subscription',\n      true: httpSubscriptionLink({\n        url: 'http://localhost:3000',\n        // ponyfill EventSource\n        EventSource: EventSourcePolyfill,\n        // options to pass to the EventSourcePolyfill constructor\n        eventSourceOptions: async ({ op }) => {\n          //                          ^ Includes the operation that's being executed\n          // you can use this to generate a signature for the operation\n          const signature = await getSignature(op);\n          return {\n            headers: {\n              authorization: 'Bearer supersecret',\n              'x-signature': signature,\n            },\n          };\n        },\n      }),\n      false: httpBatchLink({\n        url: 'http://localhost:3000',\n      }),\n    }),\n  ],\n});\nCopy\nUpdating configuration on an active connection​\n\nhttpSubscriptionLink leverages SSE through EventSource, ensuring that connections encountering errors like network failures or bad response codes are automatically retried. However, EventSource does not allow re-execution of the eventSourceOptions() or url() options to update its configuration, which is particularly important in scenarios where authentication has expired since the last connection.\n\nTo address this limitation, you can use a retryLink in conjunction with httpSubscriptionLink. This approach ensures that the connection is re-established with the latest configuration, including any updated authentication details.\n\nCAUTION\n\nPlease note that restarting the connection will result in the EventSource being recreated from scratch, which means any previously tracked events will be lost.\n\nimport {\n  createTRPCClient,\n  httpBatchLink,\n  httpSubscriptionLink,\n  retryLink,\n  splitLink,\n} from '@trpc/client';\nimport {\n  EventSourcePolyfill,\n  EventSourcePolyfillInit,\n} from 'event-source-polyfill';\nimport type { AppRouter } from '../server/index.js';\n// Initialize the tRPC client\nconst trpc = createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({\n  links: [\n    splitLink({\n      condition: (op) => op.type === 'subscription',\n      false: httpBatchLink({\n        url: 'http://localhost:3000',\n      }),\n      true: [\n        retryLink({\n          retry: (opts) => {\n            opts.op.type;\n            //       ^? will always be 'subscription' since we're in a splitLink\n            const code = opts.error.data?.code;\n            if (!code) {\n              // This shouldn't happen as our httpSubscriptionLink will automatically retry within when there's a non-parsable response\n              console.error('No error code found, retrying', opts);\n              return true;\n            }\n            if (code === 'UNAUTHORIZED' || code === 'FORBIDDEN') {\n              console.log('Retrying due to 401/403 error');\n              return true;\n            }\n            return false;\n          },\n        }),\n        httpSubscriptionLink({\n          url: async () => {\n            // calculate the latest URL if needed...\n            return getAuthenticatedUri();\n          },\n          // ponyfill EventSource\n          EventSource: EventSourcePolyfill,\n          eventSourceOptions: async () => {\n            // ...or maybe renew an access token\n            const token = await auth.getOrRenewToken();\n            return {\n              headers: {\n                authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,\n              },\n            };\n          },\n        }),\n      ],\n    }),\n  ],\n});\nCopy\nConnection params​\n\nIn order to authenticate with EventSource, you can define connectionParams in httpSubscriptionLink. This will be sent as part of the URL, which is why other methods are preferred).\n\nserver/context.ts\nimport type { CreateHTTPContextOptions } from '@trpc/server/adapters/standalone';\n \nexport const createContext = async (opts: CreateHTTPContextOptions) => {\n  const token = opts.info.connectionParams?.token;\n         \nconst token: string | undefined\n \n  // [... authenticate]\n \n  return {};\n};\n \nexport type Context = Awaited<ReturnType<typeof createContext>>;\nCopy\nclient/trpc.ts\nimport {\n  createTRPCClient,\n  httpBatchLink,\n  httpSubscriptionLink,\n  splitLink,\n} from '@trpc/client';\nimport type { AppRouter } from '../server/index.js';\n// Initialize the tRPC client\nconst trpc = createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({\n  links: [\n    splitLink({\n      condition: (op) => op.type === 'subscription',\n      true: httpSubscriptionLink({\n        url: 'http://localhost:3000',\n        connectionParams: async () => {\n          // Will be serialized as part of the URL\n          return {\n            token: 'supersecret',\n          };\n        },\n      }),\n      false: httpBatchLink({\n        url: 'http://localhost:3000',\n      }),\n    }),\n  ],\n});\nCopy\nTimeout Configuration​\n\nThe httpSubscriptionLink supports configuring a timeout for inactivity through the reconnectAfterInactivityMs option. If no messages (including ping messages) are received within the specified timeout period, the connection will be marked as \"connecting\" and automatically attempt to reconnect.\n\nThe timeout configuration is set on the server side when initializing tRPC:\n\nserver/trpc.ts\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nexport const t = initTRPC.create({\n  sse: {\n    client: {\n      reconnectAfterInactivityMs: 3_000,\n    },\n  },\n});\nCopy\nServer Ping Configuration​\n\nThe server can be configured to send periodic ping messages to keep the connection alive and prevent timeout disconnections. This is particularly useful when combined with the reconnectAfterInactivityMs-option.\n\nserver/trpc.ts\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nexport const t = initTRPC.create({\n  sse: {\n    // Maximum duration of a single SSE connection in milliseconds\n    // maxDurationMs: 60_00,\n    ping: {\n      // Enable periodic ping messages to keep connection alive\n      enabled: true,\n      // Send ping message every 2s\n      intervalMs: 2_000,\n    },\n    // client: {\n    //   reconnectAfterInactivityMs: 3_000\n    // }\n  },\n});\nCopy\nCompatibility (React Native)​\n\nThe httpSubscriptionLink makes use of the EventSource API, Streams API, and AsyncIterators, these are not natively supported by React Native and will have to be ponyfilled.\n\nTo ponyfill EventSource we recommend to use a polyfill that utilizes the networking library exposed by React Native, over using a polyfill that using the XMLHttpRequest API. Libraries that polyfill EventSource using XMLHttpRequest fail to reconnect after the app has been in the background. Consider using the rn-eventsource-reborn package.\n\nThe Streams API can be ponyfilled using the web-streams-polyfill package.\n\nAsyncIterators can be polyfilled using the @azure/core-asynciterator-polyfill package.\n\nInstallation​\n\nInstall the required polyfills:\n\nnpm\nyarn\npnpm\nbun\ndeno\nnpm install rn-eventsource-reborn web-streams-polyfill @azure/core-asynciterator-polyfill\n\nAdd the polyfills to your project before the link is used (e.g. where you add your TRPCReact.Provider):\n\nutils/api.tsx\nimport '@azure/core-asynciterator-polyfill';\nimport { RNEventSource } from 'rn-eventsource-reborn';\nimport { ReadableStream, TransformStream } from 'web-streams-polyfill';\nglobalThis.ReadableStream = globalThis.ReadableStream || ReadableStream;\nglobalThis.TransformStream = globalThis.TransformStream || TransformStream;\nCopy\n\nOnce the ponyfills are added, you can continue setting up the httpSubscriptionLink as described in the setup section.\n\nhttpSubscriptionLink Options​\ntype HTTPSubscriptionLinkOptions<\n  TRoot extends AnyClientTypes,\n  TEventSource extends EventSourceLike.AnyConstructor = typeof EventSource,\n> = {\n  /**\n   * EventSource ponyfill\n   */\n  EventSource?: TEventSource;\n  /**\n   * EventSource options or a callback that returns them\n   */\n  eventSourceOptions?:\n    | EventSourceLike.InitDictOf<TEventSource>\n    | ((opts: {\n        op: Operation;\n      }) =>\n        | EventSourceLike.InitDictOf<TEventSource>\n        | Promise<EventSourceLike.InitDictOf<TEventSource>>);\n};\nCopy\nSSE Options on the server​\nexport interface SSEStreamProducerOptions<TValue = unknown> {\n  ping?: {\n    /**\n     * Enable ping comments sent from the server\n     * @default false\n     */\n    enabled: boolean;\n    /**\n     * Interval in milliseconds\n     * @default 1000\n     */\n    intervalMs?: number;\n  };\n  /**\n   * Maximum duration in milliseconds for the request before ending the stream\n   * @default undefined\n   */\n  maxDurationMs?: number;\n  /**\n   * End the request immediately after data is sent\n   * Only useful for serverless runtimes that do not support streaming responses\n   * @default false\n   */\n  emitAndEndImmediately?: boolean;\n  /**\n   * Client-specific options - these will be sent to the client as part of the first message\n   * @default {}\n   */\n  client?: {\n    /**\n     * Timeout and reconnect after inactivity in milliseconds\n     * @default undefined\n     */\n    reconnectAfterInactivityMs?: number;\n  };\n}\nCopy\nEdit this page"

We think it's the future and recommend using this over the classic client, read the announcement post for more information about this change.\n\nTIP\n\nYou can try this integration out on the homepage of tRPC.io: https://trpc.io/?try=minimal-react#try-it-out\n\n❓ Do I have to use an integration?\nSetup​\n1. Install dependencies​\n\nThe following dependencies should be installed\n\nnpm\nyarn\npnpm\nbun\ndeno\nnpm install @trpc/server @trpc/client @trpc/tanstack-react-query @tanstack/react-query\n2. Import your AppRouter​\n\nImport your AppRouter type into the client application. This type holds the shape of your entire API.\n\nutils/trpc.ts\nimport type { AppRouter } from '../server/router';\nCopy\nTIP\n\nBy using import type you ensure that the reference will be stripped at compile-time, meaning you don't inadvertently import server-side code into your client. For more information, see the Typescript docs.\n\n3a. Set up the tRPC context provider​\n\nIn cases where you rely on React context, such as when using server-side rendering in full-stack frameworks like Next.js, it's important to create a new QueryClient for each request so that your users don't end up sharing the same cache, you can use the createTRPCContext to create a set of type-safe context providers and consumers from your AppRouter type signature.\n\nutils/trpc.ts\nimport { createTRPCContext } from '@trpc/tanstack-react-query';\nimport type { AppRouter } from '../server/router';\n \nexport const { TRPCProvider, useTRPC, useTRPCClient } = createTRPCContext<AppRouter>();\nCopy\n\nThen, create a tRPC client, and wrap your application in the TRPCProvider, as below. You will also need to set up and connect React Query, which they document in more depth.\n\nTIP\n\nIf you already use React Query in your application, you should re-use the QueryClient and QueryClientProvider you already have. You can read more about the QueryClient initialization in the React Query docs.\n\ncomponents/App.tsx\nimport { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { createTRPCClient, httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client';\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { TRPCProvider } from './utils/trpc';\nfunction makeQueryClient() {\n  return new QueryClient({\n    defaultOptions: {\n      queries: {\n        // With SSR, we usually want to set some default staleTime\n        // above 0 to avoid refetching immediately on the client\n        staleTime: 60 * 1000,\n      },\n    },\n  });\n}\nlet browserQueryClient: QueryClient | undefined = undefined;\nfunction getQueryClient() {\n  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {\n    // Server: always make a new query client\n    return makeQueryClient();\n  } else {\n    // Browser: make a new query client if we don't already have one\n    // This is very important, so we don't re-make a new client if React\n    // suspends during the initial render.

Set up with Query/Mutation Key Prefixing enabled​\n\nIf you want to prefix all queries and mutations with a specific key, see Query Key Prefixing for setup and usage examples.\n\n3c. Set up without React context​\n\nWhen building an SPA using only client-side rendering with something like Vite, you can create the QueryClient and tRPC client outside of React context as singletons.\n\nutils/trpc.ts\nimport { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { createTRPCClient, httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client';\nimport { createTRPCOptionsProxy } from '@trpc/tanstack-react-query';\nimport type { AppRouter } from '../server/router';\nexport const queryClient = new QueryClient();\nconst trpcClient = createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({\n  links: [httpBatchLink({ url: 'http://localhost:2022' })],\n});\nexport const trpc = createTRPCOptionsProxy<AppRouter>({\n  client: trpcClient,\n  queryClient,\n});\nCopy\ncomponents/App.tsx\nimport { QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { queryClient } from './utils/trpc';\nexport function App() {\n  return (\n    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>\n      {/* Your app here */}\n    </QueryClientProvider>\n  );\n}\nCopy\n4. Fetch data​\n\nYou can now use the tRPC React Query integration to call queries and mutations on your API.\n\ncomponents/user-list.tsx\nimport { useMutation, useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { useTRPC } from '../utils/trpc';\nexport default function UserList() {\n  const trpc = useTRPC(); // use `import { trpc } from './utils/trpc'` if you're using the singleton pattern\n  const userQuery = useQuery(trpc.getUser.queryOptions({ id: 'id_bilbo' }));\n  const userCreator = useMutation(trpc.createUser.mutationOptions());\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>{userQuery.data?.name}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => userCreator.mutate({ name: 'Frodo' })}>\n        Create Frodo\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nCopy\nEdit this page"

But you will probably want to try a combination of...\n\nCodemod migration​\nINFO\n\nThe codemod is a work in progress and we're looking for help to make it better. If you're interested in contributing to the codemod, please see Julius' comment here.\n\nWe're working on a codemod to help you migrate your existing codebase over to the new client. This is already available to try but we need your feedback and contributions to improve it. Codemods are very tricky to get right so we're looking for your help to make it as effective as possible.\n\nRun our upgrade CLI:\n\nnpx @trpc/upgrade\nCopy\n\nWhen prompted, select the transforms Migrate Hooks to xxxOptions API and Migrate context provider setup.\n\nGradual migration​\n\nThe new and classic clients are compatible with each other and can live together in the same application. This means you can start migrating by using the new client in new parts of your application, and gradually migrate over existing usage as you see fit. Most importantly, Query Keys are identical, which means you can use the new client and classic client together and still rely on TanStack Query's caching.\n\nMigrating Queries​\n\nA classic query would look like this\n\nimport { trpc } from './trpc';\nfunction Users() {\n  const greetingQuery = trpc.greeting.useQuery({ name: 'Jerry' });\n  // greetingQuery.data === 'Hello Jerry'\n}\nCopy\n\nand changes to\n\nimport { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { useTRPC } from './trpc';\nfunction Users() {\n  const trpc = useTRPC();\n  const greetingQuery = useQuery(trpc.greeting.queryOptions({ name: 'Jerry' }));\n  // greetingQuery.data === 'Hello Jerry'\n}\nCopy\nMigrating Invalidations and other QueryClient usages​\n\nA classic query would look like this\n\nimport { trpc } from './trpc';\nfunction Users() {\n  const utils = trpc.useUtils();\n  async function invalidateGreeting() {\n    await utils.greeting.invalidate({ name: 'Jerry' });\n  }\n}\nCopy\n\nand changes to\n\nimport { useQuery, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { useTRPC } from './trpc';\nfunction Users() {\n  const trpc = useTRPC();\n  const queryClient = useQueryClient();\n  async function invalidateGreeting() {\n    await queryClient.invalidateQueries(\n      trpc.greeting.queryFilter({ name: 'Jerry' }),\n    );\n  }\n}\nCopy\n\nThis is the same for any QueryClient usage, instead of using tRPC's useUtils you can now follow the TanStack documentation directly\n\nMigrating Mutations​\n\nA classic mutation might look like this\n\nimport { trpc } from './trpc';\nfunction Users() {\n  const createUserMutation = trpc.createUser.useMutation();\n  createUserMutation.mutate({ name: 'Jerry' });\n}\nCopy\n\nand changes to\n\nimport { useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { useTRPC } from './trpc';\nfunction Users() {\n  const trpc = useTRPC();\n  const createUserMutation = useMutation(trpc.createUser.mutationOptions());\n  createUserMutation.mutate({ name: 'Jerry' });\n}\nCopy\nEdit this page"

    "html": "Client Usage\nTanStack React Query (⭐️)\nUsage\nVersion: 11.x\nTanStack React Query\n\nCompared to our classic React Query Integration this client is simpler and more TanStack Query-native, providing factories for common TanStack React Query interfaces like QueryKeys, QueryOptions, and MutationOptions. We think it's the future and recommend using this over the classic client, read the announcement post for more information about this change.\n\nQuick example query​\nimport { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { useTRPC } from './trpc';\nfunction Users() {\n  const trpc = useTRPC();\n  const greetingQuery = useQuery(trpc.greeting.queryOptions({ name: 'Jerry' }));\n  // greetingQuery.data === 'Hello Jerry'\n}\nCopy\nUsage​\n\nThe philosophy of this client is to provide thin and type-safe factories which work natively and type-safely with Tanstack React Query. This means just by following the autocompletes the client gives you, you can focus on building just with the knowledge the TanStack React Query docs provide.\n\nexport default function Basics() {\n  const trpc = useTRPC();\n  const queryClient = useQueryClient();\n  // Create QueryOptions which can be passed to query hooks\n  const myQueryOptions = trpc.path.to.query.queryOptions({ /** inputs */ })\n  const myQuery = useQuery(myQueryOptions)\n  // or:\n  // useSuspenseQuery(myQueryOptions)\n  // useInfiniteQuery(myQueryOptions)\n  // Create MutationOptions which can be passed to useMutation\n  const myMutationOptions = trpc.path.to.mutation.mutationOptions()\n  const myMutation = useMutation(myMutationOptions)\n  // Create a QueryKey which can be used to manipulated many methods\n  // on TanStack's QueryClient in a type-safe manner\n  const myQueryKey = trpc.path.to.query.queryKey()\n  const invalidateMyQueryKey = () => {\n    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: myQueryKey })\n  }\n  return (\n    // Your app here\n  )\n}\nCopy\n\nThe trpc object is fully type-safe and will provide autocompletes for all the procedures in your AppRouter. At the end of the proxy, the following methods are available:\n\nqueryOptions - querying data​\n\nAvailable for all query procedures. Provides a type-safe wrapper around Tanstack's queryOptions function. The first argument is the input for the procedure, and the second argument accepts any native Tanstack React Query options.\n\nconst queryOptions = trpc.path.to.query.queryOptions(\n  {\n    /** input */\n  },\n  {\n    // Any Tanstack React Query options\n    staleTime: 1000,\n  },\n);\nCopy\n\nYou can additionally provide a trpc object to the queryOptions function to provide tRPC request options to the client.\n\nconst queryOptions = trpc.path.to.query.queryOptions(\n  {\n    /** input */\n  },\n  {\n    trpc: {\n      // Provide tRPC request options to the client\n      context: {\n        // see https://trpc.io/docs/client/links#managing-context\n      },\n    },\n  },\n);\nCopy\n\nIf you want to disable a query in a type safe way, you can use skipToken:\n\nimport { skipToken } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nconst query = useQuery(\n  trpc.user.details.queryOptions(\n    user?.id && project?.id\n      ? {\n          userId: user.id,\n          projectId: project.id,\n        }\n      : skipToken,\n    {\n      staleTime: 1000,\n    },\n  ),\n);\nCopy\n\nThe result can be passed to useQuery or useSuspenseQuery hooks or query client methods like fetchQuery, prefetchQuery, prefetchInfiniteQuery, invalidateQueries, etc.\n\ninfiniteQueryOptions - querying infinite data​\n\nAvailable for all query procedures that takes a cursor input. Provides a type-safe wrapper around Tanstack's infiniteQueryOptions function. The first argument is the input for the procedure, and the second argument accepts any native Tanstack React Query options.\n\nconst infiniteQueryOptions = trpc.path.to.query.infiniteQueryOptions(\n  {\n    /** input */\n  },\n  {\n    // Any Tanstack React Query options\n    getNextPageParam: (lastPage, pages) => lastPage.nextCursor,\n  },\n);\nCopy\nqueryKey - getting the query key and performing operations on the query client​\n\nAvailable for all query procedures. Allows you to access the query key in a type-safe manner.\n\nconst queryKey = trpc.path.to.query.queryKey();\nCopy\n\nSince Tanstack React Query uses fuzzy matching for query keys, you can also create a partial query key for any sub-path to match all queries belonging to a router:\n\nconst queryKey = trpc.router.pathKey();\nCopy\n\nOr even the root path to match all tRPC queries:\n\nconst queryKey = trpc.pathKey();\nCopy\nqueryFilter - creating query filters​\n\nAvailable for all query procedures. Allows creating query filters in a type-safe manner.\n\nconst queryFilter = trpc.path.to.query.queryFilter(\n  {\n    /** input */\n  },\n  {\n    // Any Tanstack React Query filter\n    predicate: (query) => {\n      query.state.data;\n    },\n  },\n);\nCopy\n\nLike with query keys, if you want to run a filter across a whole router you can use pathFilter to target any sub-path.\n\nconst queryFilter = trpc.path.pathFilter({\n  // Any Tanstack React Query filter\n  predicate: (query) => {\n    query.state.data;\n  },\n});\nCopy\n\nUseful for creating filters that can be passed to client methods like queryClient.invalidateQueries etc.\n\nmutationOptions - creating mutation options​\n\nAvailable for all mutation procedures. Provides a type-safe identify function for constructing options that can be passed to useMutation.\n\nconst mutationOptions = trpc.path.to.mutation.mutationOptions({\n  // Any Tanstack React Query options\n  onSuccess: (data) => {\n    // do something with the data\n  },\n});\nCopy\nmutationKey - getting the mutation key​\n\nAvailable for all mutation procedures. Allows you to get the mutation key in a type-safe manner.\n\nconst mutationKey = trpc.path.to.mutation.mutationKey();\nCopy\nsubscriptionOptions - creating subscription options​\n\nTanStack does not provide a subscription hook, so we continue to expose our own abstraction here which works with a standard tRPC subscription setup. Available for all subscription procedures. Provides a type-safe identify function for constructing options that can be passed to useSubscription. Note that you need to have either the httpSubscriptionLink or wsLink configured in your tRPC client to use subscriptions.\n\nfunction SubscriptionExample() {\n  const trpc = useTRPC();\n  const subscription = useSubscription(\n    trpc.path.to.subscription.subscriptionOptions(\n      {\n        /** input */\n      },\n      {\n        enabled: true,\n        onStarted: () => {\n          // do something when the subscription is started\n        },\n        onData: (data) => {\n          // you can handle the data here\n        },\n        onError: (error) => {\n          // you can handle the error here\n        },\n        onConnectionStateChange: (state) => {\n          // you can handle the connection state here\n        },\n      },\n    ),\n  );\n  // Or you can handle the state here\n  subscription.data; // The lastly received data\n  subscription.error; // The lastly received error\n  /**\n   * The current status of the subscription.\n   * Will be one of: `'idle'`, `'connecting'`, `'pending'`, or `'error'`.\n   *\n   * - `idle`: subscription is disabled or ended\n   * - `connecting`: trying to establish a connection\n   * - `pending`: connected to the server, receiving data\n   * - `error`: an error occurred and the subscription is stopped\n   */\n  subscription.status;\n  // Reset the subscription (if you have an error etc)\n  subscription.reset();\n  return <>{/* ... */}</>;\n}\nCopy\nQuery Key Prefixing​\n\nWhen using multiple tRPC providers in a single application (e.g., connecting to different backend services), queries with the same path will collide in the cache. You can prevent this by enabling query key prefixing.\n\n// Without prefixes - these would collide!\nconst authQuery = useQuery(trpcAuth.list.queryOptions()); // auth service\nconst billingQuery = useQuery(trpcBilling.list.queryOptions()); // billing service\nCopy\n\nEnable the feature flag when creating your context:\n\nutils/trpc.ts\n// [...]\nconst billing = createTRPCContext<BillingRouter, { keyPrefix: true }>();\nexport const BillingProvider = billing.TRPCProvider;\nexport const useBilling = billing.useTRPC;\nexport const createBillingClient = () =>\n  createTRPCClient<BillingRouter>({\n    links: [\n      /* ... */\n    ],\n  });\nconst account = createTRPCContext<AccountRouter, { keyPrefix: true }>();\nexport const AccountProvider = account.TRPCProvider;\nexport const useAccount = account.useTRPC;\nexport const createAccountClient = () =>\n  createTRPCClient<AccountRouter>({\n    links: [\n      /* ... */\n    ],\n  });\nCopy\nApp.tsx\n// [...]\nexport function App() {\n  const [queryClient] = useState(() => new QueryClient());\n  const [billingClient] = useState(() => createBillingClient());\n  const [accountClient] = useState(() => createAccountClient());\n  return (\n    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>\n      <BillingProvider\n        trpcClient={billingClient}\n        queryClient={queryClient}\n        keyPrefix=\"billing\"\n      >\n        <AccountProvider\n          trpcClient={accountClient}\n          queryClient={queryClient}\n          keyPrefix=\"account\"\n        >\n          {/* ... */}\n        </AccountProvider>\n      </BillingProvider>\n    </QueryClientProvider>\n  );\n}\nCopy\ncomponents/MyComponent.tsx\n// [...]\nexport function MyComponent() {\n  const billing = useBilling();\n  const account = useAccount();\n  const billingList = useQuery(billing.list.queryOptions());\n  const accountList = useQuery(account.list.queryOptions());\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div>Billing: {JSON.stringify(billingList.data ?? null)}</div>\n      <div>Account: {JSON.stringify(accountList.data ?? null)}</div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nCopy\n\nThe query keys will be properly prefixed to avoid collisions:\n\n// Example of how the query keys look with prefixes\nconst queryKeys = [\n  [['billing'], ['list'], { type: 'query' }],\n  [['account'], ['list'], { type: 'query' }],\n];\nCopy\nInferring Input and Output types​\n\nWhen you need to infer the input and output types for a procedure or router, there are 2 options available depending on the situation.\n\nInfer the input and output types of a full router\n\nimport type { inferRouterInputs, inferRouterOutputs } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { AppRouter } from './path/to/server';\nexport type Inputs = inferRouterInputs<AppRouter>;\nexport type Outputs = inferRouterOutputs<AppRouter>;\nCopy\n\nInfer types for a single procedure\n\nimport type { inferInput, inferOutput } from '@trpc/tanstack-react-query';\nfunction Component() {\n  const trpc = useTRPC();\n  type Input = inferInput<typeof trpc.path.to.procedure>;\n  type Output = inferOutput<typeof trpc.path.to.procedure>;\n}\nCopy\nAccessing the tRPC client​\n\nIf you used the setup with React Context, you can access the tRPC client using the useTRPCClient hook.\n\nimport { useTRPCClient } from './trpc';\nfunction Component() {\n  const trpcClient = useTRPCClient();\n  const result = await trpcClient.path.to.procedure.query({\n    /** input */\n  });\n}\nCopy\n\nIf you setup without React Context, you can import the global client instance directly instead.\n\nimport { client } from './trpc';\nconst result = await client.path.to.procedure.query({\n  /** input */\n});\nCopy\nEdit this page"

    "html": "Client Usage\nTanStack React Query (⭐️)\nServer Components\nVersion: 11.x\nSet up with React Server Components\n\nThis guide is an overview of how one may use tRPC with a React Server Components (RSC) framework such as Next.js App Router. Be aware that RSC on its own solves a lot of the same problems tRPC was designed to solve, so you may not need tRPC at all.\n\nThere are also not a one-size-fits-all way to integrate tRPC with RSCs, so see this guide as a starting point and adjust it to your needs and preferences.\n\nINFO\n\nIf you're looking for how to use tRPC with Server Actions, check out this blog post by Julius.\n\nCAUTION\n\nPlease read React Query's Advanced Server Rendering docs before proceeding to understand the different types of server rendering and what footguns to avoid.\n\nAdd tRPC to existing projects​\n1. Install deps​\nnpm\nyarn\npnpm\nbun\ndeno\nnpm install @trpc/server @trpc/client @trpc/tanstack-react-query @tanstack/react-query@latest zod client-only server-only\n2. Create a tRPC router​\n\nInitialize your tRPC backend in trpc/init.ts using the initTRPC function, and create your first router. We're going to make a simple \"hello world\" router and procedure here - but for deeper information on creating your tRPC API you should refer to the Quickstart guide and Backend usage docs for tRPC information.\n\nINFO\n\nThe file names used here are not enforced by tRPC. You may use any file structure you wish.\n\nView sample backend\n3. Create a Query Client factory​\n\nCreate a shared file trpc/query-client.ts that exports a function that creates a QueryClient instance.\n\ntrpc/query-client.ts\nimport {\n  defaultShouldDehydrateQuery,\n  QueryClient,\n} from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport superjson from 'superjson';\nexport function makeQueryClient() {\n  return new QueryClient({\n    defaultOptions: {\n      queries: {\n        staleTime: 30 * 1000,\n      },\n      dehydrate: {\n        // serializeData: superjson.serialize,\n        shouldDehydrateQuery: (query) =>\n          defaultShouldDehydrateQuery(query) ||\n          query.state.status === 'pending',\n      },\n      hydrate: {\n        // deserializeData: superjson.deserialize,\n      },\n    },\n  });\n}\nCopy\n\nWe're setting a few default options here:\n\nstaleTime: With SSR, we usually want to set some default staleTime above 0 to avoid refetching immediately on the client.\nshouldDehydrateQuery: This is a function that determines whether a query should be dehydrated or not. Since the RSC transport protocol supports hydrating promises over the network, we extend the defaultShouldDehydrateQuery function to also include queries that are still pending. This will allow us to start prefetching in a server component high up the tree, then consuming that promise in a client component further down.\nserializeData and deserializeData (optional): If you set up a data transformer in the previous step, set this option to make sure the data is serialized correctly when hydrating the query client over the server-client boundary.\n4. Create a tRPC client for Client Components​\n\nThe trpc/client.tsx is the entrypoint when consuming your tRPC API from client components. In here, import the type definition of your tRPC router and create typesafe hooks using createTRPCContext. We'll also export our context provider from this file.\n\ntrpc/client.tsx\n'use client';\n// ^-- to make sure we can mount the Provider from a server component\nimport type { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { createTRPCClient, httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client';\nimport { createTRPCContext } from '@trpc/tanstack-react-query';\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { makeQueryClient } from './query-client';\nimport type { AppRouter } from './routers/_app';\nexport const { TRPCProvider, useTRPC } = createTRPCContext<AppRouter>();\nlet browserQueryClient: QueryClient;\nfunction getQueryClient() {\n  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {\n    // Server: always make a new query client\n    return makeQueryClient();\n  }\n  // Browser: make a new query client if we don't already have one\n  // This is very important, so we don't re-make a new client if React\n  // suspends during the initial render. This may not be needed if we\n  // have a suspense boundary BELOW the creation of the query client\n  if (!browserQueryClient) browserQueryClient = makeQueryClient();\n  return browserQueryClient;\n}\nfunction getUrl() {\n  const base = (() => {\n    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') return '';\n    if (process.env.VERCEL_URL) return `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`;\n    return 'http://localhost:3000';\n  })();\n  return `${base}/api/trpc`;\n}\nexport function TRPCReactProvider(\n  props: Readonly<{\n    children: React.ReactNode;\n  }>,\n) {\n  // NOTE: Avoid useState when initializing the query client if you don't\n  //       have a suspense boundary between this and the code that may\n  //       suspend because React will throw away the client on the initial\n  //       render if it suspends and there is no boundary\n  const queryClient = getQueryClient();\n  const [trpcClient] = useState(() =>\n    createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({\n      links: [\n        httpBatchLink({\n          // transformer: superjson, <-- if you use a data transformer\n          url: getUrl(),\n        }),\n      ],\n    }),\n  );\n  return (\n    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>\n      <TRPCProvider trpcClient={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>\n        {props.children}\n      </TRPCProvider>\n    </QueryClientProvider>\n  );\n}\nCopy\n\nMount the provider in the root of your application (e.g. app/layout.tsx when using Next.js).\n\n5. Create a tRPC caller for Server Components​\n\nTo prefetch queries from server components, we create a proxy from our router. You can also pass in a client if your router is on a separate server.\n\ntrpc/server.tsx\nimport 'server-only'; // <-- ensure this file cannot be imported from the client\nimport { createTRPCOptionsProxy } from '@trpc/tanstack-react-query';\nimport { cache } from 'react';\nimport { createTRPCContext } from './init';\nimport { makeQueryClient } from './query-client';\nimport { appRouter } from './routers/_app';\n// IMPORTANT: Create a stable getter for the query client that\n//            will return the same client during the same request.\nexport const getQueryClient = cache(makeQueryClient);\nexport const trpc = createTRPCOptionsProxy({\n  ctx: createTRPCContext,\n  router: appRouter,\n  queryClient: getQueryClient,\n});\n// If your router is on a separate server, pass a client:\ncreateTRPCOptionsProxy({\n  client: createTRPCClient({\n    links: [httpLink({ url: '...' })],\n  }),\n  queryClient: getQueryClient,\n});\nCopy\nUsing your API​\n\nNow you can use your tRPC API in your app. While you can use the React Query hooks in client components just like you would in any other React app, we can take advantage of the RSC capabilities by prefetching queries in a server component high up the tree. You may be familiar with this concept as \"render as you fetch\" commonly implemented as loaders. This means the request fires as soon as possible but without suspending until the data is needed by using the useQuery or useSuspenseQuery hooks.\n\nThis approach leverages Next.js App Router's streaming capabilities, initiating the query on the server and streaming data to the client as it becomes available. It optimizes both the time to first byte in the browser and the data fetch time, resulting in faster page loads. However, greeting.data may initially be undefined before the data streams in.\n\nIf you prefer to avoid this initial undefined state, you can await the prefetchQuery call. This ensures the query on the client always has data on first render, but it comes with a tradeoff - the page will load more slowly since the server must complete the query before sending HTML to the client.\n\napp/page.tsx\nimport { dehydrate, HydrationBoundary } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { getQueryClient, trpc } from '~/trpc/server';\nimport { ClientGreeting } from './client-greeting';\nexport default async function Home() {\n  const queryClient = getQueryClient();\n  void queryClient.prefetchQuery(\n    trpc.hello.queryOptions({\n      /** input */\n    }),\n  );\n  return (\n    <HydrationBoundary state={dehydrate(queryClient)}>\n      <div>...</div>\n      {/** ... */}\n      <ClientGreeting />\n    </HydrationBoundary>\n  );\n}\nCopy\napp/client-greeting.tsx\n'use client';\n// <-- hooks can only be used in client components\nimport { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { useTRPC } from '~/trpc/client';\nexport function ClientGreeting() {\n  const trpc = useTRPC();\n  const greeting = useQuery(trpc.hello.queryOptions({ text: 'world' }));\n  if (!greeting.data) return <div>Loading...</div>;\n  return <div>{greeting.data.greeting}</div>;\n}\nCopy\nTIP\n\nYou can also create a prefetch and HydrateClient helper functions to make it a bit more consice and reusable:\n\ntrpc/server.tsx\nexport function HydrateClient(props: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const queryClient = getQueryClient();\n  return (\n    <HydrationBoundary state={dehydrate(queryClient)}>\n      {props.children}\n    </HydrationBoundary>\n  );\n}\nexport function prefetch<T extends ReturnType<TRPCQueryOptions<any>>>(\n  queryOptions: T,\n) {\n  const queryClient = getQueryClient();\n  if (queryOptions.queryKey[1]?.type === 'infinite') {\n    void queryClient.prefetchInfiniteQuery(queryOptions as any);\n  } else {\n    void queryClient.prefetchQuery(queryOptions);\n  }\n}\nCopy\n\nThen you can use it like this:\n\nimport { HydrateClient, prefetch, trpc } from '~/trpc/server';\nfunction Home() {\n  prefetch(\n    trpc.hello.queryOptions({\n      /** input */\n    }),\n  );\n  return (\n    <HydrateClient>\n      <div>...</div>\n      {/** ... */}\n      <ClientGreeting />\n    </HydrateClient>\n  );\n}\nCopy\nLeveraging Suspense​\n\nYou may prefer handling loading and error states using Suspense and Error Boundaries. You can do this by using the useSuspenseQuery hook.\n\napp/page.tsx\nimport { HydrateClient, prefetch, trpc } from '~/trpc/server';\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from 'react-error-boundary';\nimport { ClientGreeting } from './client-greeting';\nexport default async function Home() {\n  prefetch(trpc.hello.queryOptions());\n  return (\n    <HydrateClient>\n      <div>...</div>\n      {/** ... */}\n      <ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Something went wrong</div>}>\n        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n          <ClientGreeting />\n        </Suspense>\n      </ErrorBoundary>\n    </HydrateClient>\n  );\n}\nCopy\napp/client-greeting.tsx\n'use client';\nimport { useSuspenseQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { trpc } from '~/trpc/client';\nexport function ClientGreeting() {\n  const trpc = useTRPC();\n  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(trpc.hello.queryOptions());\n  return <div>{data.greeting}</div>;\n}\nCopy\nGetting data in a server component​\n\nIf you need access to the data in a server component, we recommend creating a server caller and using it directly. Please note that this method is detached from your query client and does not store the data in the cache. This means that you cannot use the data in a server component and expect it to be available in the client. This is intentional and explained in more detail in the Advanced Server Rendering guide.\n\ntrpc/server.tsx\n// ...\nexport const caller = appRouter.createCaller(createTRPCContext);\nCopy\napp/page.tsx\nimport { caller } from '~/trpc/server';\nexport default async function Home() {\n  const greeting = await caller.hello();\n  //    ^? { greeting: string }\n  return <div>{greeting.greeting}</div>;\n}\nCopy\n\nIf you really need to use the data both on the server as well as inside client components and understand the tradeoffs explained in the Advanced Server Rendering guide, you can use fetchQuery instead of prefetch to have the data both on the server as well as hydrating it down to the client:\n\napp/page.tsx\nimport { getQueryClient, HydrateClient, trpc } from '~/trpc/server';\nexport default async function Home() {\n  const queryClient = getQueryClient();\n  const greeting = await queryClient.fetchQuery(trpc.hello.queryOptions());\n  // Do something with greeting on the server\n  return (\n    <HydrateClient>\n      <div>...</div>\n      {/** ... */}\n      <ClientGreeting />\n    </HydrateClient>\n  );\n}\nCopy\nEdit this page"

Install dependencies​\n\nThe following dependencies should be installed\n\nnpm\nyarn\npnpm\nbun\ndeno\nnpm install @trpc/server @trpc/client @trpc/react-query @tanstack/react-query\n2. Import your AppRouter​\n\nImport your AppRouter type into the client application. This type holds the shape of your entire API.\n\nutils/trpc.ts\nimport type { AppRouter } from '../server/router';\nCopy\nTIP\n\nBy using import type you ensure that the reference will be stripped at compile-time, meaning you don't inadvertently import server-side code into your client. For more information, see the Typescript docs.\n\n3. Create tRPC hooks​\n\nCreate a set of strongly-typed React hooks from your AppRouter type signature with createTRPCReact.\n\nutils/trpc.ts\nimport { createTRPCReact } from '@trpc/react-query';\nimport type { AppRouter } from '../server/router';\n \nexport const trpc = createTRPCReact<AppRouter>();\nCopy\n4. Add tRPC providers​\n\nCreate a tRPC client, and wrap your application in the tRPC Provider, as below. You will also need to set up and connect React Query, which they document in more depth.\n\nTIP\n\nIf you already use React Query in your application, you should re-use the QueryClient and QueryClientProvider you already have.\n\nApp.tsx\nimport { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client';\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { trpc } from './utils/trpc';\nexport function App() {\n  const [queryClient] = useState(() => new QueryClient());\n  const [trpcClient] = useState(() =>\n    trpc.createClient({\n      links: [\n        httpBatchLink({\n          url: 'http://localhost:3000/trpc',\n          // You can pass any HTTP headers you wish here\n          async headers() {\n            return {\n              authorization: getAuthCookie(),\n            };\n          },\n        }),\n      ],\n    }),\n  );\n  return (\n    <trpc.Provider client={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>\n      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>\n        {/* Your app here */}\n      </QueryClientProvider>\n    </trpc.Provider>\n  );\n}\nCopy\nNOTE\n\nThe reason for using useState in the creation of the queryClient and the TRPCClient, as opposed to declaring them outside of the component, is to ensure that each request gets a unique client when using SSR. If you use client side rendering then you can move them if you wish.\n\n5. Fetch data​\n\nYou can now use the tRPC React Query integration to call queries and mutations on your API.\n\npages/IndexPage.tsx\nimport { trpc } from '../utils/trpc';\n \nexport default function IndexPage() {\n  const userQuery = trpc.getUser.useQuery({ id: 'id_bilbo' });\n  const userCreator = trpc.createUser.useMutation();\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>{userQuery.data?.name}</p>\n \n      <button onClick={() => userCreator.mutate({ name: 'Frodo' })}>\n        Create Frodo\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nCopy\nEdit this page"

    "html": "Client Usage\nReact Query Integration (Classic)\nServer Components\nVersion: 11.x\nSet up with React Server Components\nTIP\n\nThese are the docs for our 'Classic' React Query integration, which (while still supported) is not the recommended way to start new tRPC projects with TanStack React Query. We recommend using the new TanStack React Query Integration instead.\n\nThis guide is an overview of how one may use tRPC with a React Server Components (RSC) framework such as Next.js App Router. Be aware that RSC on its own solves a lot of the same problems tRPC was designed to solve, so you may not need tRPC at all.\n\nThere are also not a one-size-fits-all way to integrate tRPC with RSCs, so see this guide as a starting point and adjust it to your needs and preferences.\n\nINFO\n\nIf you're looking for how to use tRPC with Server Actions, check out this blog post by Julius.\n\nCAUTION\n\nPlease read React Query's Advanced Server Rendering docs before proceeding to understand the different types of server rendering and what footguns to avoid.\n\nAdd tRPC to existing projects​\n1. Install deps​\nnpm\nyarn\npnpm\nbun\ndeno\nnpm install @trpc/server @trpc/client @trpc/react-query @tanstack/react-query@latest zod client-only server-only\n2. Create a tRPC router​\n\nInitialize your tRPC backend in trpc/init.ts using the initTRPC function, and create your first router. We're going to make a simple \"hello world\" router and procedure here - but for deeper information on creating your tRPC API you should refer to the Quickstart guide and Backend usage docs for tRPC information.\n\nINFO\n\nThe file names used here are not enforced by tRPC. You may use any file structure you wish.\n\nView sample backend\n3. Create a Query Client factory​\n\nCreate a shared file trpc/query-client.ts that exports a function that creates a QueryClient instance.\n\ntrpc/query-client.ts\nimport {\n  defaultShouldDehydrateQuery,\n  QueryClient,\n} from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport superjson from 'superjson';\nexport function makeQueryClient() {\n  return new QueryClient({\n    defaultOptions: {\n      queries: {\n        staleTime: 30 * 1000,\n      },\n      dehydrate: {\n        // serializeData: superjson.serialize,\n        shouldDehydrateQuery: (query) =>\n          defaultShouldDehydrateQuery(query) ||\n          query.state.status === 'pending',\n      },\n      hydrate: {\n        // deserializeData: superjson.deserialize,\n      },\n    },\n  });\n}\nCopy\n\nWe're setting a few default options here:\n\nstaleTime: With SSR, we usually want to set some default staleTime above 0 to avoid refetching immediately on the client.\nshouldDehydrateQuery: This is a function that determines whether a query should be dehydrated or not. Since the RSC transport protocol supports hydrating promises over the network, we extend the defaultShouldDehydrateQuery function to also include queries that are still pending. This will allow us to start prefetching in a server component high up the tree, then consuming that promise in a client component further down.\nserializeData and deserializeData (optional): If you set up a data transformer in the previous step, set this option to make sure the data is serialized correctly when hydrating the query client over the server-client boundary.\n4. Create a tRPC client for Client Components​\n\nThe trpc/client.tsx is the entrypoint when consuming your tRPC API from client components. In here, import the type definition of your tRPC router and create typesafe hooks using createTRPCReact. We'll also export our context provider from this file.\n\ntrpc/client.tsx\n'use client';\n// ^-- to make sure we can mount the Provider from a server component\nimport type { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client';\nimport { createTRPCReact } from '@trpc/react-query';\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { makeQueryClient } from './query-client';\nimport type { AppRouter } from './routers/_app';\nexport const trpc = createTRPCReact<AppRouter>();\nlet clientQueryClientSingleton: QueryClient;\nfunction getQueryClient() {\n  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {\n    // Server: always make a new query client\n    return makeQueryClient();\n  }\n  // Browser: use singleton pattern to keep the same query client\n  return (clientQueryClientSingleton ??= makeQueryClient());\n}\nfunction getUrl() {\n  const base = (() => {\n    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') return '';\n    if (process.env.VERCEL_URL) return `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`;\n    return 'http://localhost:3000';\n  })();\n  return `${base}/api/trpc`;\n}\nexport function TRPCProvider(\n  props: Readonly<{\n    children: React.ReactNode;\n  }>,\n) {\n  // NOTE: Avoid useState when initializing the query client if you don't\n  //       have a suspense boundary between this and the code that may\n  //       suspend because React will throw away the client on the initial\n  //       render if it suspends and there is no boundary\n  const queryClient = getQueryClient();\n  const [trpcClient] = useState(() =>\n    trpc.createClient({\n      links: [\n        httpBatchLink({\n          // transformer: superjson, <-- if you use a data transformer\n          url: getUrl(),\n        }),\n      ],\n    }),\n  );\n  return (\n    <trpc.Provider client={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>\n      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>\n        {props.children}\n      </QueryClientProvider>\n    </trpc.Provider>\n  );\n}\nCopy\n\nMount the provider in the root of your application (e.g. app/layout.tsx when using Next.js).\n\n5. Create a tRPC caller for Server Components​\n\nTo prefetch queries from server components, we use a tRPC caller. The @trpc/react-query/rsc module exports a thin wrapper around createCaller that integrates with your React Query client.\n\ntrpc/server.tsx\nimport 'server-only'; // <-- ensure this file cannot be imported from the client\nimport { createHydrationHelpers } from '@trpc/react-query/rsc';\nimport { cache } from 'react';\nimport { createCallerFactory, createTRPCContext } from './init';\nimport { makeQueryClient } from './query-client';\nimport { appRouter } from './routers/_app';\n// IMPORTANT: Create a stable getter for the query client that\n//            will return the same client during the same request.\nexport const getQueryClient = cache(makeQueryClient);\nconst caller = createCallerFactory(appRouter)(createTRPCContext);\nexport const { trpc, HydrateClient } = createHydrationHelpers<typeof appRouter>(\n  caller,\n  getQueryClient,\n);\nCopy\nUsing your API​\n\nNow you can use your tRPC API in your app. While you can use the React Query hooks in client components just like you would in any other React app, we can take advantage of the RSC capabilities by prefetching queries in a server component high up the tree. You may be familiar with this concept as \"render as you fetch\" commonly implemented as loaders. This means the request fires as soon as possible but without suspending until the data is needed by using the useQuery or useSuspenseQuery hooks.\n\napp/page.tsx\nimport { trpc } from '~/trpc/server';\nimport { ClientGreeting } from './client-greeting';\nexport default async function Home() {\n  void trpc.hello.prefetch();\n  return (\n    <HydrateClient>\n      <div>...</div>\n      {/** ... */}\n      <ClientGreeting />\n    </HydrateClient>\n  );\n}\nCopy\napp/client-greeting.tsx\n'use client';\n// <-- hooks can only be used in client components\nimport { trpc } from '~/trpc/client';\nexport function ClientGreeting() {\n  const greeting = trpc.hello.useQuery();\n  if (!greeting.data) return <div>Loading...</div>;\n  return <div>{greeting.data.greeting}</div>;\n}\nCopy\nLeveraging Suspense​\n\nYou may prefer handling loading and error states using Suspense and Error Boundaries. You can do this by using the useSuspenseQuery hook.\n\napp/page.tsx\nimport { trpc } from '~/trpc/server';\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from 'react-error-boundary';\nimport { ClientGreeting } from './client-greeting';\nexport default async function Home() {\n  void trpc.hello.prefetch();\n  return (\n    <HydrateClient>\n      <div>...</div>\n      {/** ... */}\n      <ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Something went wrong</div>}>\n        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n          <ClientGreeting />\n        </Suspense>\n      </ErrorBoundary>\n    </HydrateClient>\n  );\n}\nCopy\napp/client-greeting.tsx\n'use client';\nimport { trpc } from '~/trpc/client';\nexport function ClientGreeting() {\n  const [data] = trpc.hello.useSuspenseQuery();\n  return <div>{data.greeting}</div>;\n}\nCopy\nGetting data in a server component​\n\nIf you need access to the data in a server component, you can invoke the procedure directly instead of using .prefetch(), just like you use the normal server caller. Please note that this method is de-attached from your query client and does not store the data in the cache. This means that you cannot use the data in a server component and expect it to be available in the client. This is intentional and explained in more detail in the Advanced Server Rendering guide.\n\napp/page.tsx\nimport { trpc } from '~/trpc/server';\nexport default async function Home() {\n  // Use the caller directly without using `.prefetch()`\n  const greeting = await trpc.hello();\n  //    ^? { greeting: string }\n  return <div>{greeting.greeting}</div>;\n}\nCopy\nEdit this page"

Note that this does not work the other way around, i.e., you can not enable ssr on a procedure if your global config is set to false.\ntrpc.abortOnUnmount: Override the global config and opt in or out of aborting queries on unmount.\ntrpc.context: Add extra meta data that could be used in Links.\nTIP\n\nIf you need to set any options but don't want to pass any input, you can pass undefined instead.\n\nYou'll notice that you get autocompletion on the input based on what you have set in your input schema on your backend.\n\nExample usage​\nBackend code\ncomponents/MyComponent.tsx\nimport { trpc } from '../utils/trpc';\nexport function MyComponent() {\n  // input is optional, so we don't have to pass second argument\n  const helloNoArgs = trpc.hello.useQuery();\n  const helloWithArgs = trpc.hello.useQuery({ text: 'client' });\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Hello World Example</h1>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          helloNoArgs ({helloNoArgs.status}):{' '}\n          <pre>{JSON.stringify(helloNoArgs.data, null, 2)}</pre>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          helloWithArgs ({helloWithArgs.status}):{' '}\n          <pre>{JSON.stringify(helloWithArgs.data, null, 2)}</pre>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nCopy\nStreaming responses using async generators​\nINFO\n\nSince v11 we now support streaming queries when using the httpBatchStreamLink.\n\nWhen returning an async generators in a query, you will:\n\nGet the results of the iterator in the data-property as an array which updates as the response comes in\nThe status will be success as soon as the first chunk is received.\nThe fetchStatus property which will be fetching until the last chunk is received.\nExample​\nserver/routers/_app.ts\nimport { publicProcedure, router } from './trpc';\nconst appRouter = router({\n  iterable: publicProcedure.query(async function* () {\n    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));\n      yield i;\n    }\n  }),\n});\nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\nCopy\ncomponents/MyComponent.tsx\nimport { trpc } from '~/utils';\nexport function MyComponent() {\n  const result = trpc.iterable.useQuery();\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {result.data?.map((chunk, index) => (\n        <Fragment key={index}>{chunk}</Fragment>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nCopy\n\nresult properties while streaming:\n\nstatus\tfetchStatus\tdata\n'pending'\t'fetching'\tundefined\n'success'\t'fetching'\t[]\n'success'\t'fetching'\t[1]\n'success'\t'fetching'\t[1, 2]\n'success'\t'fetching'\t[1, 2, 3]\n'success'\t'idle'\t[1, 2, 3]\nEdit this page"

    "html": "Client Usage\nReact Query Integration (Classic)\nuseUtils()\nVersion: 11.x\nuseUtils\n\nuseUtils is a hook that gives you access to helpers that let you manage the cached data of the queries you execute via @trpc/react-query. These helpers are actually thin wrappers around @tanstack/react-query's queryClient methods. If you want more in-depth information about options and usage patterns for useContext helpers than what we provide here, we will link to their respective @tanstack/react-query docs so you can refer to them accordingly.\n\nNOTE\n\nThis hook was called useContext() until 10.41.0 (and is still aliased for the foreseeable future)\n\nUsage​\n\nuseUtils returns an object with all the available queries you have in your routers. You use it the same way as your trpc client object. Once you reach a query, you'll have access to the query helpers. For example, let's say you have a post router with an all query:\n\nserver.ts\n// @filename: server.ts\nimport { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n \nconst t = initTRPC.create();\n \nconst appRouter = t.router({\n  post: t.router({\n    all: t.procedure.query(() => {\n      return {\n        posts: [\n          { id: 1, title: 'everlong' },\n          { id: 2, title: 'After Dark' },\n        ],\n      };\n    }),\n  }),\n});\n \nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\nCopy\n\nNow in our component, when we navigate the object useUtils gives us and reach the post.all query, we'll get access to our query helpers!\n\nMyComponent.tsx\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const utils = trpc.useUtils();\n  utils.post.all.f;\n                  \nfetch\nfetchInfinite\n  // [...]\n}\nCopy\nHelpers​\n\nThese are the helpers you'll get access to via useUtils. The table below will help you know which tRPC helper wraps which @tanstack/react-query helper method. Each react-query method will link to its respective docs/guide:\n\ntRPC helper wrapper\t@tanstack/react-query helper method\nfetch\tqueryClient.fetchQuery\nprefetch\tqueryClient.prefetchQuery\nfetchInfinite\tqueryClient.fetchInfiniteQuery\nprefetchInfinite\tqueryClient.prefetchInfiniteQuery\nensureData\tqueryClient.ensureData\ninvalidate\tqueryClient.invalidateQueries\nrefetch\tqueryClient.refetchQueries\ncancel\tqueryClient.cancelQueries\nsetData\tqueryClient.setQueryData\nsetQueriesData\tqueryClient.setQueriesData\ngetData\tqueryClient.getQueryData\nsetInfiniteData\tqueryClient.setInfiniteQueryData\ngetInfiniteData\tqueryClient.getInfiniteData\nsetMutationDefaults\tqueryClient.setMutationDefaults\ngetMutationDefaults\tqueryClient.getMutationDefaults\nisMutating\tqueryClient.isMutating\n❓ The function I want isn't here!​\n\n@tanstack/react-query has a lot of functions that we haven't put in the tRPC context yet. If you need a function that isn't here, feel free to open a feature request requesting it.\n\nIn the meantime, you can import and use the function directly from @tanstack/react-query. We also provide a getQueryKey which you can use to get the correct queryKey on the filters when using these functions.\n\nProxy client​\n\nIn addition to the above react-query helpers, the context also exposes your tRPC proxy client. This lets you call your procedures with async/await without needing to create an additional vanilla client.\n\nimport { trpc } from '../utils/trpc';\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState();\n  const utils = trpc.useUtils();\n  return (\n    <Form\n      handleSubmit={async (event) => {\n        const apiKey = await utils.client.apiKey.create.mutate(event);\n        setApiKey(apiKey);\n      }}\n    >\n      ...\n    </Form>\n  );\n}\nCopy\nQuery Invalidation​\n\nYou invalidate queries via the invalidate helper. invalidate is actually a special helper given that, unlike the other helpers, it's available at every level of the router map. This means you can either run invalidate on a single query, a whole router, or every router if you want. We get more in detail in the sections below.\n\nInvalidating a single query​\n\nYou can invalidate a query relating to a single procedure and even filter based on the input passed to it to prevent unnecessary calls to the back end.\n\nExample code​\nimport { trpc } from '../utils/trpc';\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const utils = trpc.useUtils();\n  const mutation = trpc.post.edit.useMutation({\n    onSuccess(input) {\n      utils.post.all.invalidate();\n      utils.post.byId.invalidate({ id: input.id }); // Will not invalidate queries for other id's 👍\n    },\n  });\n  // [...]\n}\nCopy\nInvalidating across whole routers​\n\nIt is also possible to invalidate queries across an entire router rather then just one query.\n\nExample code​\nBackend code\nimport { trpc } from '../utils/trpc';\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const utils = trpc.useUtils();\n  const invalidateAllQueriesAcrossAllRouters = () => {\n    // 1️⃣\n    // All queries on all routers will be invalidated 🔥\n    utils.invalidate();\n  };\n  const invalidateAllPostQueries = () => {\n    // 2️⃣\n    // All post queries will be invalidated 📭\n    utils.post.invalidate();\n  };\n  const invalidatePostById = () => {\n    // 3️⃣\n    // All queries in the post router with input {id:1} invalidated 📭\n    utils.post.byId.invalidate({ id: 1 });\n  };\n  // Example queries\n  trpc.user.all.useQuery(); // Would only be validated by 1️⃣ only.\n  trpc.post.all.useQuery(); // Would be invalidated by 1️⃣ & 2️⃣\n  trpc.post.byId.useQuery({ id: 1 }); // Would be invalidated by 1️⃣, 2️⃣ and 3️⃣\n  trpc.post.byId.useQuery({ id: 2 }); // would be invalidated by 1️⃣ and 2️⃣ but NOT 3️⃣!\n  // [...]\n}\nCopy\nInvalidate full cache on every mutation​\n\nKeeping track of exactly what queries a mutation should invalidate is hard, therefore, it can be a pragmatic solution to invalidate the full cache as a side-effect on any mutation. Since we have request batching, this invalidation will simply refetch all queries on the page you're looking at in one single request.\n\nWe have added a feature to help with this:\n\nexport const trpc = createTRPCReact<AppRouter, SSRContext>({\n  overrides: {\n    useMutation: {\n      /**\n       * This function is called whenever a `.useMutation` succeeds\n       **/\n      async onSuccess(opts) {\n        /**\n         * @note that order here matters:\n         * The order here allows route changes in `onSuccess` without\n         * having a flash of content change whilst redirecting.\n         **/\n        // Calls the `onSuccess` defined in the `useQuery()`-options:\n        await opts.originalFn();\n        // Invalidate all queries in the react-query cache:\n        await opts.queryClient.invalidateQueries();\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\nCopy\nAdditional Options​\n\nAside from the query helpers, the object useUtils returns also contains the following properties:\n\ninterface ProxyTRPCContextProps<TRouter extends AnyRouter, TSSRContext> {\n  /**\n   * The `TRPCClient`\n   */\n  client: TRPCClient<TRouter>;\n  /**\n   * The SSR context when server-side rendering\n   * @default null\n   */\n  ssrContext?: TSSRContext | null;\n  /**\n   * State of SSR hydration.\n   * - `false` if not using SSR.\n   * - `prepass` when doing a prepass to fetch queries' data\n   * - `mounting` before TRPCProvider has been rendered on the client\n   * - `mounted` when the TRPCProvider has been rendered on the client\n   * @default false\n   */\n  ssrState?: SSRState;\n  /**\n   * Abort loading query calls when unmounting a component - usually when navigating to a new page\n   * @default false\n   */\n  abortOnUnmount?: boolean;\n}\nCopy\nEdit this page"

If you want more in-depth information about options and usage patterns for useUtils helpers than what we provide here, we will link to their respective @tanstack/react-query docs so you can refer to them accordingly.\n\nThe difference between useUtils and createTRPCQueryUtils is that useUtils is a react hook that uses useQueryClient under the hood.

Instead, you would create a new queryClient for every request so that there's no cross-request data leakage.\n\nHelpers​\n\nMuch like useUtils, createTRPCQueryUtils gives you access to same set of helpers.

Additionally, if the underlying procedure is using something like Prisma's findUnique() it will automatically batch & do exactly 1 database query as a well.\n\nconst Component = (props: { postIds: string[] }) => {\n  const postQueries = trpc.useQueries((t) =>\n    props.postIds.map((id) => t.post.byId({ id })),\n  );\n  return <>{/* [...] */}</>;\n};\nCopy\nProviding options to individual queries​\n\nYou can also pass in any normal query options to the second parameter of any of the query calls in the array such as enabled, suspense, refetchOnWindowFocus...etc. For a complete overview of all the available options, see the tanstack useQuery documentation.\n\nconst Component = () => {\n  const [post, greeting] = trpc.useQueries((t) => [\n    t.post.byId({ id: '1' }, { enabled: false }),\n    t.greeting({ text: 'world' }),\n  ]);\n  const onButtonClick = () => {\n    post.refetch();\n  };\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{post.data && post.data.title}</h1>\n      <p>{greeting.data.message}</p>\n      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Click to fetch</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\nCopy\nContext​\n\nYou can also pass in an optional React Query context to override the default.\n\nconst [post, greeting] = trpc.useQueries(\n  (t) => [t.post.byId({ id: '1' }), t.greeting({ text: 'world' })],\n  myCustomContext,\n);\nCopy\nEdit this page"

However, you can customize the logging behavior and the way it prints to the console with your own implementations.\n\nUsage​\n\nYou can import and add the loggerLink to the links array as such:\n\nclient/index.ts\nimport { createTRPCClient, httpBatchLink, loggerLink } from '@trpc/client';\nimport type { AppRouter } from '../server';\nconst client = createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({\n  links: [\n    /**\n     * The function passed to enabled is an example in case you want to the link to\n     * log to your console in development and only log errors in production\n     */\n    loggerLink({\n      enabled: (opts) =>\n        (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' &&\n          typeof window !== 'undefined') ||\n        (opts.direction === 'down' && opts.result instanceof Error),\n    }),\n    httpBatchLink({\n      url: 'http://localhost:3000',\n    }),\n  ],\n});\nCopy\nloggerLink Options​\n\nThe loggerLink function takes an options object that has the LoggerLinkOptions shape:\n\ntype LoggerLinkOptions<TRouter extends AnyRouter> = {\n  logger?: LogFn<TRouter>;\n  /**\n   * It is a function that returns a condition that determines whether to enable the logger.\n   * It is true by default.\n   */\n  enabled?: EnabledFn<TRouter>;\n  /**\n   * Used in the built-in defaultLogger\n   */\n  console?: ConsoleEsque;\n  /**\n   * Color mode used in the default logger.\n   * @default typeof window === 'undefined' ? 'ansi' : 'css'\n   */\n  colorMode?: 'ansi' | 'css';\n};\nCopy\nReference​\n\nYou can check out the source code for this link on GitHub.\n\nEdit this page"

    "html": "Client Usage\nLinks\nRetry Link\nVersion: 11.x\nRetry Link\n\nretryLink is a link that allows you to retry failed operations in your tRPC client. It provides a customizable way to handle transient errors, such as network failures or server errors, by automatically retrying the failed requests based on specified conditions.\n\nTIP\n\nIf you use @trpc/react-query you will generally not need this link as it's built into the useQuery() and the useMutation() hooks from @tanstack/react-query.\n\nUsage​\n\nYou can import and add the retryLink to the links array when creating your tRPC client. This link can be placed before or after other links in your setup, depending on your requirements.\n\nimport { createTRPCClient, retryLink } from '@trpc/client';\nconst client = createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({\n  links: [\n    retryLink({\n      retry(opts) {\n        if (\n          opts.error.data &&\n          opts.error.data.code !== 'INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR'\n        ) {\n          // Don't retry on non-500s\n          return false;\n        }\n        if (opts.op.type !== 'query') {\n          // Only retry queries\n          return false;\n        }\n        // Retry up to 3 times\n        return opts.attempts <= 3;\n      },\n      // Double every attempt, with max of 30 seconds (starting at 1 second)\n      retryDelayMs: (attemptIndex) => Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 30000),\n    }),\n    httpBatchLink({\n      url: 'http://localhost:3000',\n    }),\n  ],\n});\nCopy\n\nIn the example above, we add the retryLink before the httpBatchLink. By default, retryLink will:\n\nRetry the request if the error is a TRPCClientError with a status code of 500 or if we couldn't get a valid TRPC error.\nRetry the request up to 3 times.\n\nYou can customize the retry logic by providing a custom retry function.\n\nOptions​\ninterface RetryLinkOptions<TInferrable extends InferrableClientTypes> {\n  /**\n   * The retry function\n   */\n  retry: (opts: RetryFnOptions<TInferrable>) => boolean;\n  /**\n   * The delay between retries in ms (defaults to 0)\n   */\n  retryDelayMs?: (attempt: number) => number;\n}\ninterface RetryFnOptions<TInferrable extends InferrableClientTypes> {\n  /**\n   * The operation that failed\n   */\n  op: Operation;\n  /**\n   * The error that occurred\n   */\n  error: TRPCClientError<TInferrable>;\n  /**\n   * The number of attempts that have been made (including the first call)\n   */\n  attempts: number;\n}\nCopy\nHandling tracked() events​\n\nWhen using retryLink with subscriptions that use tracked(), the link will automatically include the last known event ID when retrying. This ensures that when a subscription reconnects, it can resume from where it left off without missing any events.\n\nFor example, if you're using Server-sent Events (SSE) with httpSubscriptionLink, the retryLink will automatically handle reconnecting with the last event ID when errors like 401 Unauthorized occur.\n\nEdit this page"

    "html": "Basic usage\nCopy markdown\nEdit this page\n\nThis page will walk you through the basics of creating schemas, parsing data, and using inferred types. For complete documentation on Zod's schema API, refer to Defining schemas.\n\nDefining a schema\n\nBefore you can do anything else, you need to define a schema. For the purposes of this guide, we'll use a simple object schema.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nimport * as z from \"zod\"; \n \nconst Player = z.object({ \n  username: z.string(),\n  xp: z.number()\n});\nParsing data\n\nGiven any Zod schema, use .parse to validate an input. If it's valid, Zod returns a strongly-typed deep clone of the input.\n\nPlayer.parse({ username: \"billie\", xp: 100 }); \n// => returns { username: \"billie\", xp: 100 }\n\nNote — If your schema uses certain asynchronous APIs like async refinements or transforms, you'll need to use the .parseAsync() method instead.\n\nawait Player.parseAsync({ username: \"billie\", xp: 100 }); \nHandling errors\n\nWhen validation fails, the .parse() method will throw a ZodError instance with granular information about the validation issues.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\ntry {\n  Player.parse({ username: 42, xp: \"100\" });\n} catch(error){\n  if(error instanceof z.ZodError){\n    error.issues; \n    /* [\n      {\n        expected: 'string',\n        code: 'invalid_type',\n        path: [ 'username' ],\n        message: 'Invalid input: expected string'\n      },\n      {\n        expected: 'number',\n        code: 'invalid_type',\n        path: [ 'xp' ],\n        message: 'Invalid input: expected number'\n      }\n    ] */\n  }\n}\n\nTo avoid a try/catch block, you can use the .safeParse() method to get back a plain result object containing either the successfully parsed data or a ZodError. The result type is a discriminated union, so you can handle both cases conveniently.\n\nconst result = Player.safeParse({ username: 42, xp: \"100\" });\nif (!result.success) {\n  result.error;   // ZodError instance\n} else {\n  result.data;    // { username: string; xp: number }\n}\n\nNote — If your schema uses certain asynchronous APIs like async refinements or transforms, you'll need to use the .safeParseAsync() method instead.\n\nawait schema.safeParseAsync(\"hello\");\nInferring types\n\nZod infers a static type from your schema definitions. You can extract this type with the z.infer<> utility and use it however you like.\n\nconst Player = z.object({ \n  username: z.string(),\n  xp: z.number()\n});\n \n// extract the inferred type\ntype Player = z.infer<typeof Player>;\n \n// use it in your code\nconst player: Player = { username: \"billie\", xp: 100 };\n\nIn some cases, the input & output types of a schema can diverge. For instance, the .transform() API can convert the input from one type to another. In these cases, you can extract the input and output types independently:\n\nconst mySchema = z.string().transform((val) => val.length);\n \ntype MySchemaIn = z.input<typeof mySchema>;\n// => string\n \ntype MySchemaOut = z.output<typeof mySchema>; // equivalent to z.infer<typeof mySchema>\n// number\n\nNow that we have the basics covered, let's jump into the Schema API.\n\nIntro\n\nIntroduction to Zod - TypeScript-first schema validation library with static type inference\n\nDefining schemas\n\nComplete API reference for all Zod schema types, methods, and validation features"

Read the release notes here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured sponsor: Jazz\n\nInterested in featuring? Get in touch.\n\nIntroduction\n\nZod is a TypeScript-first validation library. Using Zod, you can define schemas you can use to validate data, from a simple string to a complex nested object.\n\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n \nconst User = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n});\n \n// some untrusted data...\nconst input = { /* stuff */ };\n \n// the parsed result is validated and type safe!\nconst data = User.parse(input);\n \n// so you can use it with confidence :)\nconsole.log(data.name);\nFeatures\nZero external dependencies\nWorks in Node.js and all modern browsers\nTiny: 2kb core bundle (gzipped)\nImmutable API: methods return a new instance\nConcise interface\nWorks with TypeScript and plain JS\nBuilt-in JSON Schema conversion\nExtensive ecosystem\nInstallation\nnpm install zod\n\nZod is also available as @zod/zod on jsr.io.\n\nZod provides an MCP server that can be used by agents to search Zod's docs. To add to your editor, follow these instructions. Zod also provides an llms.txt file.\n\nRequirements\n\nZod is tested against TypeScript v5.5 and later.

    "html": "Defining schemas\nCopy markdown\nEdit this page\n\nTo validate data, you must first define a schema. Schemas represent types, from simple primitive values to complex nested objects and arrays.\n\nPrimitives\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n \n// primitive types\nz.string();\nz.number();\nz.bigint();\nz.boolean();\nz.symbol();\nz.undefined();\nz.null();\nCoercion\n\nTo coerce input data to the appropriate type, use z.coerce instead:\n\nz.coerce.string();    // String(input)\nz.coerce.number();    // Number(input)\nz.coerce.boolean();   // Boolean(input)\nz.coerce.bigint();    // BigInt(input)\n\nThe coerced variant of these schemas attempts to convert the input value to the appropriate type.\n\nconst schema = z.coerce.string();\n \nschema.parse(\"tuna\");    // => \"tuna\"\nschema.parse(42);        // => \"42\"\nschema.parse(true);      // => \"true\"\nschema.parse(null);      // => \"null\"\n\nThe input type of these coerced schemas is unknown by default. To specify a more specific input type, pass a generic parameter:\n\nconst A = z.coerce.number();\ntype AInput = z.input<typeof A>; // => unknown\n \nconst B = z.coerce.number<number>();\ntype BInput = z.input<typeof B>; // => number\nHow coercion works in Zod\nCustomizing the input type\nLiterals\n\nLiteral schemas represent a literal type, like \"hello world\" or 5.\n\nconst tuna = z.literal(\"tuna\");\nconst twelve = z.literal(12);\nconst twobig = z.literal(2n);\nconst tru = z.literal(true);\n\nTo represent the JavaScript literals null and undefined:\n\nz.null();\nz.undefined();\nz.void(); // equivalent to z.undefined()\n\nTo allow multiple literal values:\n\nconst colors = z.literal([\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]);\n \ncolors.parse(\"green\"); // ✅\ncolors.parse(\"yellow\"); // ❌\n\nTo extract the set of allowed values from a literal schema:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\ncolors.values; // => Set<\"red\" | \"green\" | \"blue\">\nStrings\n\nZod provides a handful of built-in string validation and transform APIs. To perform some common string validations:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nz.string().max(5);\nz.string().min(5);\nz.string().length(5);\nz.string().regex(/^[a-z]+$/);\nz.string().startsWith(\"aaa\");\nz.string().endsWith(\"zzz\");\nz.string().includes(\"---\");\nz.string().uppercase();\nz.string().lowercase();\n\nTo perform some simple string transforms:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nz.string().trim(); // trim whitespace\nz.string().toLowerCase(); // toLowerCase\nz.string().toUpperCase(); // toUpperCase\nz.string().normalize(); // normalize unicode characters\nString formats\n\nTo validate against some common string formats:\n\nz.email();\nz.uuid();\nz.url();\nz.httpUrl();       // http or https URLs only\nz.hostname();\nz.emoji();         // validates a single emoji character\nz.base64();\nz.base64url();\nz.hex();\nz.jwt();\nz.nanoid();\nz.cuid();\nz.cuid2();\nz.ulid();\nz.ipv4();\nz.ipv6();\nz.cidrv4();        // ipv4 CIDR block\nz.cidrv6();        // ipv6 CIDR block\nz.hash(\"sha256\");  // or \"sha1\", \"sha384\", \"sha512\", \"md5\"\nz.iso.date();\nz.iso.time();\nz.iso.datetime();\nz.iso.duration();\nEmails\n\nTo validate email addresses:\n\nz.email();\n\nBy default, Zod uses a comparatively strict email regex designed to validate normal email addresses containing common characters. It's roughly equivalent to the rules enforced by Gmail. To learn more about this regex, refer to this post.\n\n/^(?!\\.)(?!.*\\.\\.)([a-z0-9_'+\\-\\.]*)[a-z0-9_+-]@([a-z0-9][a-z0-9\\-]*\\.)+[a-z]{2,}$/i\n\nTo customize the email validation behavior, you can pass a custom regular expression to the pattern param.\n\nz.email({ pattern: /your regex here/ });\n\nZod exports several useful regexes you could use.\n\n// Zod's default email regex\nz.email();\nz.email({ pattern: z.regexes.email }); // equivalent\n \n// the regex used by browsers to validate input[type=email] fields\n// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email\nz.email({ pattern: z.regexes.html5Email });\n \n// the classic emailregex.com regex (RFC 5322)\nz.email({ pattern: z.regexes.rfc5322Email });\n \n// a loose regex that allows Unicode (good for intl emails)\nz.email({ pattern: z.regexes.unicodeEmail });\nUUIDs\n\nTo validate UUIDs:\n\nz.uuid();\n\nTo specify a particular UUID version:\n\n// supports \"v1\", \"v2\", \"v3\", \"v4\", \"v5\", \"v6\", \"v7\", \"v8\"\nz.uuid({ version: \"v4\" });\n \n// for convenience\nz.uuidv4();\nz.uuidv6();\nz.uuidv7();\n\nThe RFC 9562/4122 UUID spec requires the first two bits of byte 8 to be 10. Other UUID-like identifiers do not enforce this constraint. To validate any UUID-like identifier:\n\nz.guid();\nURLs\n\nTo validate any WHATWG-compatible URL:\n\nconst schema = z.url();\n \nschema.parse(\"https://example.com\"); // ✅\nschema.parse(\"http://localhost\"); // ✅\nschema.parse(\"mailto:noreply@zod.dev\"); // ✅\n\nAs you can see this is quite permissive. Internally this uses the new URL() constructor to validate inputs; this behavior may differ across platforms and runtimes but it's the mostly rigorous way to validate URIs/URLs on any given JS runtime/engine.\n\nTo validate the hostname against a specific regex:\n\nconst schema = z.url({ hostname: /^example\\.com$/ });\n \nschema.parse(\"https://example.com\"); // ✅\nschema.parse(\"https://zombo.com\"); // ❌\n\nTo validate the protocol against a specific regex, use the protocol param.\n\nconst schema = z.url({ protocol: /^https$/ });\n \nschema.parse(\"https://example.com\"); // ✅\nschema.parse(\"http://example.com\"); // ❌\n\nWeb URLs — In many cases, you'll want to validate Web URLs specifically. Here's the recommended schema for doing so:\n\nconst httpUrl = z.url({\n  protocol: /^https?$/,\n  hostname: z.regexes.domain\n});\n\nThis restricts the protocol to http/https and ensures the hostname is a valid domain name with the z.regexes.domain regular expression:\n\n/^([a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?\\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/\n\nTo normalize URLs, use the normalize flag. This will overwrite the input value with the normalized URL returned by new URL().\n\nnew URL(\"HTTP://ExAmPle.com:80/./a/../b?X=1#f oo\").href\n// => \"http://example.com/b?X=1#f%20oo\"\nISO datetimes\n\nAs you may have noticed, Zod string includes a few date/time related validations. These validations are regular expression based, so they are not as strict as a full date/time library. However, they are very convenient for validating user input.\n\nThe z.iso.datetime() method enforces ISO 8601; by default, no timezone offsets are allowed:\n\nconst datetime = z.iso.datetime();\n \ndatetime.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00Z\"); // ✅\ndatetime.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00.123Z\"); // ✅\ndatetime.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00.123456Z\"); // ✅ (arbitrary precision)\ndatetime.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00+02:00\"); // ❌ (offsets not allowed)\ndatetime.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00\"); // ❌ (local not allowed)\n\nTo allow timezone offsets:\n\nconst datetime = z.iso.datetime({ offset: true });\n \n// allows timezone offsets\ndatetime.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00+02:00\"); // ✅\n \n// basic offsets not allowed\ndatetime.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00+02\");    // ❌\ndatetime.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00+0200\");  // ❌\n \n// Z is still supported\ndatetime.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00Z\"); // ✅ \n\nTo allow unqualified (timezone-less) datetimes:\n\nconst schema = z.iso.datetime({ local: true });\nschema.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:01\"); // ✅\nschema.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15\"); // ✅ seconds optional\n\nTo constrain the allowable time precision. By default, seconds are optional and arbitrary sub-second precision is allowed.\n\nconst a = z.iso.datetime();\na.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15Z\"); // ✅\na.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00Z\"); // ✅\na.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00.123Z\"); // ✅\n \nconst b = z.iso.datetime({ precision: -1 }); // minute precision (no seconds)\nb.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15Z\"); // ✅\nb.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00Z\"); // ❌\nb.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00.123Z\"); // ❌\n \nconst c = z.iso.datetime({ precision: 0 }); // second precision only\nc.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15Z\"); // ❌\nc.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00Z\"); // ✅\nc.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00.123Z\"); // ❌\n \nconst d = z.iso.datetime({ precision: 3 }); // millisecond precision only\nd.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15Z\"); // ❌\nd.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00Z\"); // ❌\nd.parse(\"2020-01-01T06:15:00.123Z\"); // ✅\nISO dates\n\nThe z.iso.date() method validates strings in the format YYYY-MM-DD.\n\nconst date = z.iso.date();\n \ndate.parse(\"2020-01-01\"); // ✅\ndate.parse(\"2020-1-1\"); // ❌\ndate.parse(\"2020-01-32\"); // ❌\nISO times\n\nThe z.iso.time() method validates strings in the format HH:MM[:SS[.s+]]. By default seconds are optional, as are sub-second deciams.\n\nconst time = z.iso.time();\n \ntime.parse(\"03:15\"); // ✅\ntime.parse(\"03:15:00\"); // ✅\ntime.parse(\"03:15:00.9999999\"); // ✅ (arbitrary precision)\n\nNo offsets of any kind are allowed.\n\ntime.parse(\"03:15:00Z\"); // ❌ (no `Z` allowed)\ntime.parse(\"03:15:00+02:00\"); // ❌ (no offsets allowed)\n\nUse the precision parameter to constrain the allowable decimal precision.\n\nz.iso.time({ precision: -1 }); // HH:MM (minute precision)\nz.iso.time({ precision: 0 }); // HH:MM:SS (second precision)\nz.iso.time({ precision: 1 }); // HH:MM:SS.s (decisecond precision)\nz.iso.time({ precision: 2 }); // HH:MM:SS.ss (centisecond precision)\nz.iso.time({ precision: 3 }); // HH:MM:SS.sss (millisecond precision)\nIP addresses\nconst ipv4 = z.ipv4();\nipv4.parse(\"192.168.0.0\"); // ✅\n \nconst ipv6 = z.ipv6();\nipv6.parse(\"2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334\"); // ✅\nIP blocks (CIDR)\n\nValidate IP address ranges specified with CIDR notation.\n\nconst cidrv4 = z.string().cidrv4();\ncidrv4.parse(\"192.168.0.0/24\"); // ✅\n \nconst cidrv6 = z.string().cidrv6();\ncidrv6.parse(\"2001:db8::/32\"); // ✅\nJWTs\n\nValidate JSON Web Tokens.\n\nz.jwt();\nz.jwt({ alg: \"HS256\" });\nHashes\n\nTo validate cryptographic hash values:\n\nz.hash(\"md5\");\nz.hash(\"sha1\");\nz.hash(\"sha256\");\nz.hash(\"sha384\");\nz.hash(\"sha512\");\n\nBy default, z.hash() expects hexadecimal encoding, as is conventional. You can specify a different encoding with the enc parameter:\n\nz.hash(\"sha256\", { enc: \"hex\" });       // default\nz.hash(\"sha256\", { enc: \"base64\" });    // base64 encoding\nz.hash(\"sha256\", { enc: \"base64url\" }); // base64url encoding (no padding)\nExpected lengths and padding\nCustom formats\n\nTo define your own string formats:\n\nconst coolId = z.stringFormat(\"cool-id\", ()=>{\n  // arbitrary validation here\n  return val.length === 100 && val.startsWith(\"cool-\");\n});\n \n// a regex is also accepted\nz.stringFormat(\"cool-id\", /^cool-[a-z0-9]{95}$/);\n\nThis schema will produce \"invalid_format\" issues, which are more descriptive than the \"custom\" errors produced by refinements or z.custom().\n\nmyFormat.parse(\"invalid input!\");\n// ZodError: [\n//   {\n//     \"code\": \"invalid_format\",\n//     \"format\": \"cool-id\",\n//     \"path\": [],\n//     \"message\": \"Invalid cool-id\"\n//   }\n// ]\nTemplate literals\n\nNew — Introduced in zod@4.0.\n\nTo define a template literal schema:\n\nconst schema = z.templateLiteral([ \"hello, \", z.string(), \"!\" ]);\n// `hello, ${string}!`\n\nThe z.templateLiteral API can handle any number of string literals (e.g. \"hello\") and schemas. Any schema with an inferred type that's assignable to string | number | bigint | boolean | null | undefined can be passed.\n\nz.templateLiteral([ \"hi there\" ]);\n// `hi there`\n \nz.templateLiteral([ \"email: \", z.string() ]);\n// `email: ${string}`\n \nz.templateLiteral([ \"high\", z.literal(5) ]);\n// `high5`\n \nz.templateLiteral([ z.nullable(z.literal(\"grassy\")) ]);\n// `grassy` | `null`\n \nz.templateLiteral([ z.number(), z.enum([\"px\", \"em\", \"rem\"]) ]);\n// `${number}px` | `${number}em` | `${number}rem`\nNumbers\n\nUse z.number() to validate numbers. It allows any finite number.\n\nconst schema = z.number();\n \nschema.parse(3.14);      // ✅\nschema.parse(NaN);       // ❌\nschema.parse(Infinity);  // ❌\n\nZod implements a handful of number-specific validations:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nz.number().gt(5);\nz.number().gte(5);                     // alias .min(5)\nz.number().lt(5);\nz.number().lte(5);                     // alias .max(5)\nz.number().positive();       \nz.number().nonnegative();    \nz.number().negative(); \nz.number().nonpositive(); \nz.number().multipleOf(5);              // alias .step(5)\n\nIf (for some reason) you want to validate NaN, use z.nan().\n\nz.nan().parse(NaN);              // ✅\nz.nan().parse(\"anything else\");  // ❌\nIntegers\n\nTo validate integers:\n\nz.int();     // restricts to safe integer range\nz.int32();   // restrict to int32 range\nBigInts\n\nTo validate BigInts:\n\nz.bigint();\n\nZod includes a handful of bigint-specific validations.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nz.bigint().gt(5n);\nz.bigint().gte(5n);                    // alias `.min(5n)`\nz.bigint().lt(5n);\nz.bigint().lte(5n);                    // alias `.max(5n)`\nz.bigint().positive(); \nz.bigint().nonnegative(); \nz.bigint().negative(); \nz.bigint().nonpositive(); \nz.bigint().multipleOf(5n);             // alias `.step(5n)`\nBooleans\n\nTo validate boolean values:\n\nz.boolean().parse(true); // => true\nz.boolean().parse(false); // => false\nDates\n\nUse z.date() to validate Date instances.\n\nz.date().safeParse(new Date()); // success: true\nz.date().safeParse(\"2022-01-12T06:15:00.000Z\"); // success: false\n\nTo customize the error message:\n\nz.date({\n  error: issue => issue.input === undefined ? \"Required\" : \"Invalid date\"\n});\n\nZod provides a handful of date-specific validations.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nz.date().min(new Date(\"1900-01-01\"), { error: \"Too old!\" });\nz.date().max(new Date(), { error: \"Too young!\" });\nEnums\n\nUse z.enum to validate inputs against a fixed set of allowable string values.\n\nconst FishEnum = z.enum([\"Salmon\", \"Tuna\", \"Trout\"]);\n \nFishEnum.parse(\"Salmon\"); // => \"Salmon\"\nFishEnum.parse(\"Swordfish\"); // => ❌\n\nCareful — If you declare your string array as a variable, Zod won't be able to properly infer the exact values of each element.\n\nconst fish = [\"Salmon\", \"Tuna\", \"Trout\"];\n \nconst FishEnum = z.enum(fish);\ntype FishEnum = z.infer<typeof FishEnum>; // string\n\nTo fix this, always pass the array directly into the z.enum() function, or use as const.\n\nconst fish = [\"Salmon\", \"Tuna\", \"Trout\"] as const;\n \nconst FishEnum = z.enum(fish);\ntype FishEnum = z.infer<typeof FishEnum>; // \"Salmon\" | \"Tuna\" | \"Trout\"\n\nEnum-like object literals ({ [key: string]: string | number }) are supported.\n\nconst Fish = {\n  Salmon: \"Salmon\",\n  Tuna: \"Tuna\"\n} as const\n \nconst FishEnum = z.enum(Fish)\nFishEnum.parse(\"Salmon\"); // => \"Salmon\"\nFishEnum.parse(\"Swordfish\"); // => ❌\n\nYou can also pass in an externally-declared TypeScript enum.\n\nZod 4 — This replaces the z.nativeEnum() API in Zod 3.\n\nNote that using TypeScript's enum keyword is not recommended.\n\nenum Fish {\n  Salmon = \"Salmon\",\n  Tuna = \"Tuna\",\n  Trout = \"Trout\",\n}\n \nconst FishEnum = z.enum(Fish);\n.enum\n\nTo extract the schema's values as an enum-like object:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst FishEnum = z.enum([\"Salmon\", \"Tuna\", \"Trout\"]);\n \nFishEnum.enum;\n// => { Salmon: \"Salmon\", Tuna: \"Tuna\", Trout: \"Trout\" }\n.exclude()\n\nTo create a new enum schema, excluding certain values:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst FishEnum = z.enum([\"Salmon\", \"Tuna\", \"Trout\"]);\nconst TunaOnly = FishEnum.exclude([\"Salmon\", \"Trout\"]);\n.extract()\n\nTo create a new enum schema, extracting certain values:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst FishEnum = z.enum([\"Salmon\", \"Tuna\", \"Trout\"]);\nconst SalmonAndTroutOnly = FishEnum.extract([\"Salmon\", \"Trout\"]);\nStringbools\n\n💎 New in Zod 4\n\nIn some cases (e.g. parsing environment variables) it's valuable to parse certain string \"boolish\" values to a plain boolean value. To support this, Zod 4 introduces z.stringbool():\n\nconst strbool = z.stringbool();\n \nstrbool.parse(\"true\")         // => true\nstrbool.parse(\"1\")            // => true\nstrbool.parse(\"yes\")          // => true\nstrbool.parse(\"on\")           // => true\nstrbool.parse(\"y\")            // => true\nstrbool.parse(\"enabled\")      // => true\n \nstrbool.parse(\"false\");       // => false\nstrbool.parse(\"0\");           // => false\nstrbool.parse(\"no\");          // => false\nstrbool.parse(\"off\");         // => false\nstrbool.parse(\"n\");           // => false\nstrbool.parse(\"disabled\");    // => false\n \nstrbool.parse(/* anything else */); // ZodError<[{ code: \"invalid_value\" }]>\n\nTo customize the truthy and falsy values:\n\n// these are the defaults\nz.stringbool({\n  truthy: [\"true\", \"1\", \"yes\", \"on\", \"y\", \"enabled\"],\n  falsy: [\"false\", \"0\", \"no\", \"off\", \"n\", \"disabled\"],\n});\n\nBy default the schema is case-insensitive; all inputs are converted to lowercase before comparison to the truthy/falsy values. To make it case-sensitive:\n\nz.stringbool({\n  case: \"sensitive\"\n});\nOptionals\n\nTo make a schema optional (that is, to allow undefined inputs).\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nz.optional(z.literal(\"yoda\")); // or z.literal(\"yoda\").optional()\n\nThis returns a ZodOptional instance that wraps the original schema. To extract the inner schema:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\noptionalYoda.unwrap(); // ZodLiteral<\"yoda\">\nNullables\n\nTo make a schema nullable (that is, to allow null inputs).\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nz.nullable(z.literal(\"yoda\")); // or z.literal(\"yoda\").nullable()\n\nThis returns a ZodNullable instance that wraps the original schema. To extract the inner schema:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nnullableYoda.unwrap(); // ZodLiteral<\"yoda\">\nNullish\n\nTo make a schema nullish (both optional and nullable):\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst nullishYoda = z.nullish(z.literal(\"yoda\"));\n\nRefer to the TypeScript manual for more about the concept of nullish.\n\nUnknown\n\nZod aims to mirror TypeScript's type system one-to-one. As such, Zod provides APIs to represent the following special types:\n\n// allows any values\nz.any(); // inferred type: `any`\nz.unknown(); // inferred type: `unknown`\nNever\n\nNo value will pass validation.\n\nz.never(); // inferred type: `never`\nObjects\n\nTo define an object type:\n\n  // all properties are required by default\n  const Person = z.object({\n    name: z.string(),\n    age: z.number(),\n  });\n \n  type Person = z.infer<typeof Person>;\n  // => { name: string; age: number; }\n\nBy default, all properties are required. To make certain properties optional:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst Dog = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n  age: z.number().optional(),\n});\n \nDog.parse({ name: \"Yeller\" }); // ✅\n\nBy default, unrecognized keys are stripped from the parsed result:\n\nDog.parse({ name: \"Yeller\", extraKey: true });\n// => { name: \"Yeller\" }\nz.strictObject\n\nTo define a strict schema that throws an error when unknown keys are found:\n\nconst StrictDog = z.strictObject({\n  name: z.string(),\n});\n \nStrictDog.parse({ name: \"Yeller\", extraKey: true });\n// ❌ throws\nz.looseObject\n\nTo define a loose schema that allows unknown keys to pass through:\n\nconst LooseDog = z.looseObject({\n  name: z.string(),\n});\n \nLooseDog.parse({ name: \"Yeller\", extraKey: true });\n// => { name: \"Yeller\", extraKey: true }\n.catchall()\n\nTo define a catchall schema that will be used to validate any unrecognized keys:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst DogWithStrings = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n  age: z.number().optional(),\n}).catchall(z.string());\n \nDogWithStrings.parse({ name: \"Yeller\", extraKey: \"extraValue\" }); // ✅\nDogWithStrings.parse({ name: \"Yeller\", extraKey: 42 }); // ❌\n.shape\n\nTo access the internal schemas:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nDog.shape.name; // => string schema\nDog.shape.age; // => number schema\n.keyof()\n\nTo create a ZodEnum schema from the keys of an object schema:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst keySchema = Dog.keyof();\n// => ZodEnum<[\"name\", \"age\"]>\n.extend()\n\nTo add additional fields to an object schema:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst DogWithBreed = Dog.extend({\n  breed: z.string(),\n});\n\nThis API can be used to overwrite existing fields! Be careful with this power! If the two schemas share keys, B will override A.\n\nAlternative: spread syntax — You can alternatively avoid .extend() altogether by creating a new object schema entirely. This makes the strictness level of the resulting schema visually obvious.\n\nconst DogWithBreed = z.object({ // or z.strictObject() or z.looseObject()...\n  ...Dog.shape,\n  breed: z.string(),\n});\n\nYou can also use this to merge multiple objects in one go.\n\nconst DogWithBreed = z.object({\n  ...Animal.shape,\n  ...Pet.shape,\n  breed: z.string(),\n});\n\nThis approach has a few advantages:\n\nIt uses language-level features (spread syntax) instead of library-specific APIs\nThe same syntax works in Zod and Zod Mini\nIt's more tsc-efficient — the .extend() method can be expensive on large schemas, and due to a TypeScript limitation it gets quadratically more expensive when calls are chained\nIf you wish, you can change the strictness level of the resulting schema by using z.strictObject() or z.looseObject()\n.safeExtend()\n\nThe .safeExtend() method works similarly to .extend(), but it won't let you overwrite an existing properly with a non-assignable schema. In other words, the result of .safeExtend() will have an inferred type that extends the original (in the TypeScript sense).\n\nz.object({ a: z.string() }).safeExtend({ a: z.string().min(5) }); // ✅\nz.object({ a: z.string() }).safeExtend({ a: z.any() }); // ✅\nz.object({ a: z.string() }).safeExtend({ a: z.number() });\n//                                       ^  ❌ ZodNumber is not assignable \n\nUse .safeExtend() to extend schemas that contain refinements. (Regular .extend() will throw an error when used on schemas with refinements.)\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst Base = z.object({\n  a: z.string(),\n  b: z.string()\n}).refine(user => user.a === user.b);\n \n// Extended inherits the refinements of Base\nconst Extended = Base.safeExtend({\n  a: z.string().min(10)\n});\n.pick()\n\nInspired by TypeScript's built-in Pick and Omit utility types, Zod provides dedicated APIs for picking and omitting certain keys from an object schema.\n\nStarting from this initial schema:\n\nconst Recipe = z.object({\n  title: z.string(),\n  description: z.string().optional(),\n  ingredients: z.array(z.string()),\n});\n// { title: string; description?: string | undefined; ingredients: string[] }\n\nTo pick certain keys:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst JustTheTitle = Recipe.pick({ title: true });\n.omit()\n\nTo omit certain keys:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst RecipeNoId = Recipe.omit({ id: true });\n.partial()\n\nFor convenience, Zod provides a dedicated API for making some or all properties optional, inspired by the built-in TypeScript utility type Partial.\n\nTo make all fields optional:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst PartialRecipe = Recipe.partial();\n// { title?: string | undefined; description?: string | undefined; ingredients?: string[] | undefined }\n\nTo make certain properties optional:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst RecipeOptionalIngredients = Recipe.partial({\n  ingredients: true,\n});\n// { title: string; description?: string | undefined; ingredients?: string[] | undefined }\n.required()\n\nZod provides an API for making some or all properties required, inspired by TypeScript's Required utility type.\n\nTo make all properties required:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst RequiredRecipe = Recipe.required();\n// { title: string; description: string; ingredients: string[] }\n\nTo make certain properties required:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst RecipeRequiredDescription = Recipe.required({description: true});\n// { title: string; description: string; ingredients: string[] }\nRecursive objects\n\nTo define a self-referential type, use a getter on the key. This lets JavaScript resolve the cyclical schema at runtime.\n\nconst Category = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n  get subcategories(){\n    return z.array(Category)\n  }\n});\n \ntype Category = z.infer<typeof Category>;\n// { name: string; subcategories: Category[] }\n\nThough recursive schemas are supported, passing cyclical data into Zod will cause an infinite loop.\n\nYou can also represent mutually recursive types:\n\nconst User = z.object({\n  email: z.email(),\n  get posts(){\n    return z.array(Post)\n  }\n});\n \nconst Post = z.object({\n  title: z.string(),\n  get author(){\n    return User\n  }\n});\n\nAll object APIs (.pick(), .omit(), .required(), .partial(), etc.) work as you'd expect.\n\nCircularity errors\n\nDue to TypeScript limitations, recursive type inference can be finicky, and it only works in certain scenarios. Some more complicated types may trigger recursive type errors like this:\n\nconst Activity = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n  get subactivities() {\n    // ^ ❌ 'subactivities' implicitly has return type 'any' because it does not\n    // have a return type annotation and is referenced directly or indirectly\n    // in one of its return expressions.ts(7023)\n \n    return z.nullable(z.array(Activity));\n  },\n});\n\nIn these cases, you can resolve the error with a type annotation on the offending getter:\n\nconst Activity = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n  get subactivities(): z.ZodNullable<z.ZodArray<typeof Activity>> {\n    return z.nullable(z.array(Activity));\n  },\n});\nArrays\n\nTo define an array schema:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst stringArray = z.array(z.string()); // or z.string().array()\n\nTo access the inner schema for an element of the array.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nstringArray.unwrap(); // => string schema\n\nZod implements a number of array-specific validations:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nz.array(z.string()).min(5); // must contain 5 or more items\nz.array(z.string()).max(5); // must contain 5 or fewer items\nz.array(z.string()).length(5); // must contain 5 items exactly\nTuples\n\nUnlike arrays, tuples are typically fixed-length arrays that specify different schemas for each index.\n\nconst MyTuple = z.tuple([\n  z.string(),\n  z.number(),\n  z.boolean()\n]);\n \ntype MyTuple = z.infer<typeof MyTuple>;\n// [string, number, boolean]\n\nTo add a variadic (\"rest\") argument:\n\nconst variadicTuple = z.tuple([z.string()], z.number());\n// => [string, ...number[]];\nUnions\n\nUnion types (A | B) represent a logical \"OR\". Zod union schemas will check the input against each option in order. The first value that validates successfully is returned.\n\nconst stringOrNumber = z.union([z.string(), z.number()]);\n// string | number\n \nstringOrNumber.parse(\"foo\"); // passes\nstringOrNumber.parse(14); // passes\n\nTo extract the internal option schemas:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nstringOrNumber.options; // [ZodString, ZodNumber]\nDiscriminated unions\n\nA discriminated union is a special kind of union in which a) all the options are object schemas that b) share a particular key (the \"discriminator\"). Based on the value of the discriminator key, TypeScript is able to \"narrow\" the type signature as you'd expect.\n\ntype MyResult =\n  | { status: \"success\"; data: string }\n  | { status: \"failed\"; error: string };\n \nfunction handleResult(result: MyResult){\n  if(result.status === \"success\"){\n    result.data; // string\n  } else {\n    result.error; // string\n  }\n}\n\nYou could represent it with a regular z.union(). But regular unions are naive—they check the input against each option in order and return the first one that passes. This can be slow for large unions.\n\nSo Zod provides a z.discriminatedUnion() API that uses a discriminator key to make parsing more efficient.\n\nconst MyResult = z.discriminatedUnion(\"status\", [\n  z.object({ status: z.literal(\"success\"), data: z.string() }),\n  z.object({ status: z.literal(\"failed\"), error: z.string() }),\n]);\n\nEach option should be an object schema whose discriminator prop (status in the example above) corresponds to some literal value or set of values, usually z.enum(), z.literal(), z.null(), or z.undefined().\n\nNesting discriminated unions\nIntersections\n\nIntersection types (A & B) represent a logical \"AND\".\n\nconst a = z.union([z.number(), z.string()]);\nconst b = z.union([z.number(), z.boolean()]);\nconst c = z.intersection(a, b);\n \ntype c = z.infer<typeof c>; // => number\n\nThis can be useful for intersecting two object types.\n\nconst Person = z.object({ name: z.string() });\ntype Person = z.infer<typeof Person>;\n \nconst Employee = z.object({ role: z.string() });\ntype Employee = z.infer<typeof Employee>;\n \nconst EmployedPerson = z.intersection(Person, Employee);\ntype EmployedPerson = z.infer<typeof EmployedPerson>;\n// Person & Employee\n\nWhen merging object schemas, prefer A.extend(B) over intersections. Using .extend() will give you a new object schema, whereas z.intersection(A, B) returns a ZodIntersection instance which lacks common object methods like pick and omit.\n\nRecords\n\nRecord schemas are used to validate types such as Record<string, string>.\n\nconst IdCache = z.record(z.string(), z.string());\ntype IdCache = z.infer<typeof IdCache>; // Record<string, string>\n \nIdCache.parse({\n  carlotta: \"77d2586b-9e8e-4ecf-8b21-ea7e0530eadd\",\n  jimmie: \"77d2586b-9e8e-4ecf-8b21-ea7e0530eadd\",\n});\n\nThe key schema can be any Zod schema that is assignable to string | number | symbol.\n\nconst Keys = z.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.symbol()]);\nconst AnyObject = z.record(Keys, z.unknown());\n// Record<string | number | symbol, unknown>\n\nTo create an object schemas containing keys defined by an enum:\n\nconst Keys = z.enum([\"id\", \"name\", \"email\"]);\nconst Person = z.record(Keys, z.string());\n// { id: string; name: string; email: string }\n\nZod 4 — In Zod 4, if you pass a z.enum as the first argument to z.record(), Zod will exhaustively check that all enum values exist in the input as keys. This behavior agrees with TypeScript:\n\ntype MyRecord = Record<\"a\" | \"b\", string>;\nconst myRecord: MyRecord = { a: \"foo\", b: \"bar\" }; // ✅\nconst myRecord: MyRecord = { a: \"foo\" }; // ❌ missing required key `b`\n\nIn Zod 3, exhaustiveness was not checked. To replicate the old behavior, use z.partialRecord().\n\nIf you want a partial record type, use z.partialRecord(). This skips the special exhaustiveness checks Zod normally runs with z.enum() and z.literal() key schemas.\n\nconst Keys = z.enum([\"id\", \"name\", \"email\"]).or(z.never()); \nconst Person = z.partialRecord(Keys, z.string());\n// { id?: string; name?: string; email?: string }\nA note on numeric keys\nMaps\nconst StringNumberMap = z.map(z.string(), z.number());\ntype StringNumberMap = z.infer<typeof StringNumberMap>; // Map<string, number>\n \nconst myMap: StringNumberMap = new Map();\nmyMap.set(\"one\", 1);\nmyMap.set(\"two\", 2);\n \nStringNumberMap.parse(myMap);\nSets\nconst NumberSet = z.set(z.number());\ntype NumberSet = z.infer<typeof NumberSet>; // Set<number>\n \nconst mySet: NumberSet = new Set();\nmySet.add(1);\nmySet.add(2);\nNumberSet.parse(mySet);\n\nSet schemas can be further constrained with the following utility methods.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nz.set(z.string()).min(5); // must contain 5 or more items\nz.set(z.string()).max(5); // must contain 5 or fewer items\nz.set(z.string()).size(5); // must contain 5 items exactly\nFiles\n\nTo validate File instances:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst fileSchema = z.file();\n \nfileSchema.min(10_000); // minimum .size (bytes)\nfileSchema.max(1_000_000); // maximum .size (bytes)\nfileSchema.mime(\"image/png\"); // MIME type\nfileSchema.mime([\"image/png\", \"image/jpeg\"]); // multiple MIME types\nPromises\n\nDeprecated — z.promise() is deprecated in Zod 4. There are vanishingly few valid uses cases for a Promise schema. If you suspect a value might be a Promise, simply await it before parsing it with Zod.\n\nSee z.promise() documentation\nInstanceof\n\nYou can use z.instanceof to check that the input is an instance of a class. This is useful to validate inputs against classes that are exported from third-party libraries.\n\nclass Test {\n  name: string;\n}\n \nconst TestSchema = z.instanceof(Test);\n \nTestSchema.parse(new Test()); // ✅\nTestSchema.parse(\"whatever\"); // ❌\nProperty\n\nTo validate a particular property of a class instance against a Zod schema:\n\nconst blobSchema = z.instanceof(URL).check(\n  z.property(\"protocol\", z.literal(\"https:\" as string, \"Only HTTPS allowed\"))\n);\n \nblobSchema.parse(new URL(\"https://example.com\")); // ✅\nblobSchema.parse(new URL(\"http://example.com\")); // ❌\n\nThe z.property() API works with any data type (but it's most useful when used in conjunction with z.instanceof()).\n\nconst blobSchema = z.string().check(\n  z.property(\"length\", z.number().min(10))\n);\n \nblobSchema.parse(\"hello there!\"); // ✅\nblobSchema.parse(\"hello.\"); // ❌\nRefinements\n\nEvery Zod schema stores an array of refinements. Refinements are a way to perform custom validation that Zod doesn't provide a native API for.\n\n.refine()\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst myString = z.string().refine((val) => val.length <= 255);\n\nRefinement functions should never throw. Instead they should return a falsy value to signal failure. Thrown errors are not caught by Zod.\n\nerror\n\nTo customize the error message:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst myString = z.string().refine((val) => val.length > 8, { \n  error: \"Too short!\" \n});\nabort\n\nBy default, validation issues from checks are considered continuable; that is, Zod will execute all checks in sequence, even if one of them causes a validation error. This is usually desirable, as it means Zod can surface as many errors as possible in one go.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst myString = z.string()\n  .refine((val) => val.length > 8, { error: \"Too short!\" })\n  .refine((val) => val === val.toLowerCase(), { error: \"Must be lowercase\" });\n  \n \nconst result = myString.safeParse(\"OH NO\");\nresult.error?.issues;\n/* [\n  { \"code\": \"custom\", \"message\": \"Too short!\" },\n  { \"code\": \"custom\", \"message\": \"Must be lowercase\" }\n] */\n\nTo mark a particular refinement as non-continuable, use the abort parameter. Validation will terminate if the check fails.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst myString = z.string()\n  .refine((val) => val.length > 8, { error: \"Too short!\", abort: true })\n  .refine((val) => val === val.toLowerCase(), { error: \"Must be lowercase\", abort: true });\n \n \nconst result = myString.safeParse(\"OH NO\");\nresult.error?.issues;\n// => [{ \"code\": \"custom\", \"message\": \"Too short!\" }]\npath\n\nTo customize the error path, use the path parameter. This is typically only useful in the context of object schemas.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst passwordForm = z\n  .object({\n    password: z.string(),\n    confirm: z.string(),\n  })\n  .refine((data) => data.password === data.confirm, {\n    message: \"Passwords don't match\",\n    path: [\"confirm\"], // path of error\n  });\n\nThis will set the path parameter in the associated issue:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst result = passwordForm.safeParse({ password: \"asdf\", confirm: \"qwer\" });\nresult.error.issues;\n/* [{\n  \"code\": \"custom\",\n  \"path\": [ \"confirm\" ],\n  \"message\": \"Passwords don't match\"\n}] */\n\nTo define an asynchronous refinement, just pass an async function:\n\nconst userId = z.string().refine(async (id) => {\n  // verify that ID exists in database\n  return true;\n});\n\nIf you use async refinements, you must use the .parseAsync method to parse data! Otherwise Zod will throw an error.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst result = await userId.parseAsync(\"abc123\");\nwhen\n\nNote — This is a power user feature and can absolutely be abused in ways that will increase the probability of uncaught errors originating from inside your refinements.\n\nBy default, refinements don't run if any non-continuable issues have already been encountered. Zod is careful to ensure the type signature of the value is correct before passing it into any refinement functions.\n\nconst schema = z.string().refine((val) => {\n  return val.length > 8\n});\n \nschema.parse(1234); // invalid_type: refinement won't be executed\n\nIn some cases, you want finer control over when refinements run. For instance consider this \"password confirm\" check:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst schema = z\n  .object({\n    password: z.string().min(8),\n    confirmPassword: z.string(),\n    anotherField: z.string(),\n  })\n  .refine((data) => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {\n    message: \"Passwords do not match\",\n    path: [\"confirmPassword\"],\n  });\n \nschema.parse({\n  password: \"asdf\",\n  confirmPassword: \"asdf\",\n  anotherField: 1234 // ❌ this error will prevent the password check from running\n});\n\nAn error on anotherField will prevent the password confirmation check from executing, even though the check doesn't depend on anotherField. To control when a refinement will run, use the when parameter:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst schema = z\n  .object({\n    password: z.string().min(8),\n    confirmPassword: z.string(),\n    anotherField: z.string(),\n  })\n  .refine((data) => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {\n    message: \"Passwords do not match\",\n    path: [\"confirmPassword\"],\n \n    // run if password & confirmPassword are valid\n    when(payload) { \n      return schema \n        .pick({ password: true, confirmPassword: true }) \n        .safeParse(payload.value).success; \n    },  \n  });\n \nschema.parse({\n  password: \"asdf\",\n  confirmPassword: \"asdf\",\n  anotherField: 1234 // ❌ this error will not prevent the password check from running\n});\n.superRefine()\n\nThe regular .refine API only generates a single issue with a \"custom\" error code, but .superRefine() makes it possible to create multiple issues using any of Zod's internal issue types.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst UniqueStringArray = z.array(z.string()).superRefine((val, ctx) => {\n  if (val.length > 3) {\n    ctx.addIssue({\n      code: \"too_big\",\n      maximum: 3,\n      origin: \"array\",\n      inclusive: true,\n      message: \"Too many items 😡\",\n      input: val,\n    });\n  }\n \n  if (val.length !== new Set(val).size) {\n    ctx.addIssue({\n      code: \"custom\",\n      message: `No duplicates allowed.`,\n      input: val,\n    });\n  }\n});\n \n.check()\n\nNote — The .check() API is a more low-level API that's generally more complex than .superRefine(). It can be faster in performance-sensitive code paths, but it's also more verbose.\n\nView example\nCodecs\n\nNew — Introduced in Zod 4.1. Refer to the dedicated Codecs page for more information.\n\nCodecs are a special kind of schema that implement bidirectional transformations between two other schemas.\n\nconst stringToDate = z.codec(\n  z.iso.datetime(),  // input schema: ISO date string\n  z.date(),          // output schema: Date object\n  {\n    decode: (isoString) => new Date(isoString), // ISO string → Date\n    encode: (date) => date.toISOString(),       // Date → ISO string\n  }\n);\n\nA regular .parse() operations performs the forward transform. It calls the codec's decode function.\n\nstringToDate.parse(\"2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z\"); // => Date\n\nYou can alternatively use the top-level z.decode() function. Unlike .parse() (which accepts unknown input), z.decode() expects a strongly-typed input (string in this example).\n\nz.decode(stringToDate, \"2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z\"); // => Date\n\nTo perform the reverse transform, use the inverse: z.encode().\n\nz.encode(stringToDate, new Date(\"2024-01-15\")); // => \"2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z\"\n\nRefer to the dedicated Codecs page for more information. That page contains implementations for commonly-needed codecs that you can copy/paste into your project:\n\nstringToNumber\nstringToInt\nstringToBigInt\nnumberToBigInt\nisoDatetimeToDate\nepochSecondsToDate\nepochMillisToDate\njsonCodec\nutf8ToBytes\nbytesToUtf8\nbase64ToBytes\nbase64urlToBytes\nhexToBytes\nstringToURL\nstringToHttpURL\nuriComponent\nstringToBoolean\nPipes\n\nSchemas can be chained together into \"pipes\". Pipes are primarily useful when used in conjunction with Transforms.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst stringToLength = z.string().pipe(z.transform(val => val.length));\n \nstringToLength.parse(\"hello\"); // => 5\nTransforms\n\nNote — For bi-directional transforms, use codecs.\n\nTransforms are a special kind of schema that perform a unidirectional transformation. Instead of validating input, they accept anything and perform some transformation on the data. To define a transform:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst castToString = z.transform((val) => String(val));\n \ncastToString.parse(\"asdf\"); // => \"asdf\"\ncastToString.parse(123); // => \"123\"\ncastToString.parse(true); // => \"true\"\n\nRefinement functions should never throw. Thrown errors are not caught by Zod.\n\nTo perform validation logic inside a transform, use ctx. To report a validation issue, push a new issue onto ctx.issues (similar to the .check() API).\n\nconst coercedInt = z.transform((val, ctx) => {\n  try {\n    const parsed = Number.parseInt(String(val));\n    return parsed;\n  } catch (e) {\n    ctx.issues.push({\n      code: \"custom\",\n      message: \"Not a number\",\n      input: val,\n    });\n \n    // this is a special constant with type `never`\n    // returning it lets you exit the transform without impacting the inferred return type\n    return z.NEVER;\n  }\n});\n\nMost commonly, transforms are used in conjunction with Pipes. This combination is useful for performing some initial validation, then transforming the parsed data into another form.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst stringToLength = z.string().pipe(z.transform(val => val.length));\n \nstringToLength.parse(\"hello\"); // => 5\n.transform()\n\nPiping some schema into a transform is a common pattern, so Zod provides a convenience .transform() method.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst stringToLength = z.string().transform(val => val.length); \n\nTransforms can also be async:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst idToUser = z\n  .string()\n  .transform(async (id) => {\n    // fetch user from database\n    return db.getUserById(id); \n  });\n \nconst user = await idToUser.parseAsync(\"abc123\");\n\nIf you use async transforms, you must use a .parseAsync or .safeParseAsync when parsing data! Otherwise Zod will throw an error.\n\n.preprocess()\n\nPiping a transform into another schema is another common pattern, so Zod provides a convenience z.preprocess() function.\n\nconst coercedInt = z.preprocess((val) => {\n  if (typeof val === \"string\") {\n    return Number.parseInt(val);\n  }\n  return val;\n}, z.int());\nDefaults\n\nTo set a default value for a schema:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst defaultTuna = z.string().default(\"tuna\");\n \ndefaultTuna.parse(undefined); // => \"tuna\"\n\nAlternatively, you can pass a function which will be re-executed whenever a default value needs to be generated:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst randomDefault = z.number().default(Math.random);\n \nrandomDefault.parse(undefined);    // => 0.4413456736055323\nrandomDefault.parse(undefined);    // => 0.1871840107401901\nrandomDefault.parse(undefined);    // => 0.7223408162401552\nPrefaults\n\nIn Zod, setting a default value will short-circuit the parsing process. If the input is undefined, the default value is eagerly returned. As such, the default value must be assignable to the output type of the schema.\n\nconst schema = z.string().transform(val => val.length).default(0);\nschema.parse(undefined); // => 0\n\nSometimes, it's useful to define a prefault (\"pre-parse default\") value. If the input is undefined, the prefault value will be parsed instead. The parsing process is not short circuited. As such, the prefault value must be assignable to the input type of the schema.\n\nz.string().transform(val => val.length).prefault(\"tuna\");\nschema.parse(undefined); // => 4\n\nThis is also useful if you want to pass some input value through some mutating refinements.\n\nconst a = z.string().trim().toUpperCase().prefault(\"  tuna  \");\na.parse(undefined); // => \"TUNA\"\n \nconst b = z.string().trim().toUpperCase().default(\"  tuna  \");\nb.parse(undefined); // => \"  tuna  \"\nCatch\n\nUse .catch() to define a fallback value to be returned in the event of a validation error:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst numberWithCatch = z.number().catch(42);\n \nnumberWithCatch.parse(5); // => 5\nnumberWithCatch.parse(\"tuna\"); // => 42\n\nAlternatively, you can pass a function which will be re-executed whenever a catch value needs to be generated.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst numberWithRandomCatch = z.number().catch((ctx) => {\n  ctx.error; // the caught ZodError\n  return Math.random();\n});\n \nnumberWithRandomCatch.parse(\"sup\"); // => 0.4413456736055323\nnumberWithRandomCatch.parse(\"sup\"); // => 0.1871840107401901\nnumberWithRandomCatch.parse(\"sup\"); // => 0.7223408162401552\nBranded types\n\nTypeScript's type system is structural, meaning that two types that are structurally equivalent are considered the same.\n\ntype Cat = { name: string };\ntype Dog = { name: string };\n \nconst pluto: Dog = { name: \"pluto\" };\nconst simba: Cat = pluto; // works fine\n\nIn some cases, it can be desirable to simulate nominal typing inside TypeScript. This can be achieved with branded types (also known as \"opaque types\").\n\nconst Cat = z.object({ name: z.string() }).brand<\"Cat\">();\nconst Dog = z.object({ name: z.string() }).brand<\"Dog\">();\n \ntype Cat = z.infer<typeof Cat>; // { name: string } & z.$brand<\"Cat\">\ntype Dog = z.infer<typeof Dog>; // { name: string } & z.$brand<\"Dog\">\n \nconst pluto = Dog.parse({ name: \"pluto\" });\nconst simba: Cat = pluto; // ❌ not allowed\n\nUnder the hood, this works by attaching a \"brand\" to the schema's inferred type.\n\nconst Cat = z.object({ name: z.string() }).brand<\"Cat\">();\ntype Cat = z.infer<typeof Cat>; // { name: string } & z.$brand<\"Cat\">\n\nWith this brand, any plain (unbranded) data structures are no longer assignable to the inferred type. You have to parse some data with the schema to get branded data.\n\nNote that branded types do not affect the runtime result of .parse. It is a static-only construct.\n\nReadonly\n\nTo mark a schema as readonly:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst ReadonlyUser = z.object({ name: z.string() }).readonly();\ntype ReadonlyUser = z.infer<typeof ReadonlyUser>;\n// Readonly<{ name: string }>\n\nThe inferred type of the new schemas will be marked as readonly. Note that in TypeScript, this only affects objects, arrays, tuples, Set, and Map:\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nz.object({ name: z.string() }).readonly(); // { readonly name: string }\nz.array(z.string()).readonly(); // readonly string[]\nz.tuple([z.string(), z.number()]).readonly(); // readonly [string, number]\nz.map(z.string(), z.date()).readonly(); // ReadonlyMap<string, Date>\nz.set(z.string()).readonly(); // ReadonlySet<string>\n\nInputs will be parsed like normal, then the result will be frozen with Object.freeze() to prevent modifications.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst result = ReadonlyUser.parse({ name: \"fido\" });\nresult.name = \"simba\"; // throws TypeError\nJSON\n\nTo validate any JSON-encodable value:\n\nconst jsonSchema = z.json();\n\nThis is a convenience API that returns the following union schema:\n\nconst jsonSchema = z.lazy(() => {\n  return z.union([\n    z.string(params), \n    z.number(), \n    z.boolean(), \n    z.null(), \n    z.array(jsonSchema), \n    z.record(z.string(), jsonSchema)\n  ]);\n});\nFunctions\n\nZod provides a z.function() utility for defining Zod-validated functions. This way, you can avoid intermixing validation code with your business logic.\n\nconst MyFunction = z.function({\n  input: [z.string()], // parameters (must be an array or a ZodTuple)\n  output: z.number()  // return type\n});\n \ntype MyFunction = z.infer<typeof MyFunction>;\n// (input: string) => number\n\nFunction schemas have an .implement() method which accepts a function and returns a new function that automatically validates its inputs and outputs.\n\nconst computeTrimmedLength = MyFunction.implement((input) => {\n  // TypeScript knows input is a string!\n  return input.trim().length;\n});\n \ncomputeTrimmedLength(\"sandwich\"); // => 8\ncomputeTrimmedLength(\" asdf \"); // => 4\n\nThis function will throw a ZodError if the input is invalid:\n\ncomputeTrimmedLength(42); // throws ZodError\n\nIf you only care about validating inputs, you can omit the output field.\n\nconst MyFunction = z.function({\n  input: [z.string()], // parameters (must be an array or a ZodTuple)\n});\n \nconst computeTrimmedLength = MyFunction.implement((input) => input.trim.length);\n\nUse the .implementAsync() method to create an async function.\n\nconst computeTrimmedLengthAsync = MyFunction.implementAsync(\n  async (input) => input.trim().length\n);\n \ncomputeTrimmedLengthAsync(\"sandwich\"); // => Promise<8>\nCustom\n\nYou can create a Zod schema for any TypeScript type by using z.custom(). This is useful for creating schemas for types that are not supported by Zod out of the box, such as template string literals.\n\nconst px = z.custom<`${number}px`>((val) => {\n  return typeof val === \"string\" ? /^\\d+px$/.test(val) : false;\n});\n \ntype px = z.infer<typeof px>; // `${number}px`\n \npx.parse(\"42px\"); // \"42px\"\npx.parse(\"42vw\"); // throws;\n\nIf you don't provide a validation function, Zod will allow any value. This can be dangerous!\n\nz.custom<{ arg: string }>(); // performs no validation\n\nYou can customize the error message and other options by passing a second argument. This parameter works the same way as the params parameter of .refine.\n\nz.custom<...>((val) => ..., \"custom error message\");\n\nBasic usage\n\nBasic usage guide covering schema definition, parsing data, error handling, and type inference\n\nCustomizing errors\n\nGuide to customizing validation error messages and error handling patterns"

    "html": "Customizing errors\nCopy markdown\nEdit this page\n\nIn Zod, validation errors are surfaced as instances of the z.core.$ZodError class.\n\nThe ZodError class in the zod package is a subclass that implements some additional convenience methods.\n\nInstances of $ZodError contain an .issues array. Each issue contains a human-readable message and additional structured metadata about the issue.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n \nconst result = z.string().safeParse(12); // { success: false, error: ZodError }\nresult.error.issues;\n// [\n//   {\n//     expected: 'string',\n//     code: 'invalid_type',\n//     path: [],\n//     message: 'Invalid input: expected string, received number'\n//   }\n// ]\n\nEvery issue contains a message property with a human-readable error message. Error messages can be customized in a number of ways.\n\nThe error param\n\nVirtually every Zod API accepts an optional error message.\n\nz.string(\"Not a string!\");\n\nThis custom error will show up as the message property of any validation issues that originate from this schema.\n\nz.string(\"Not a string!\").parse(12);\n// ❌ throws ZodError {\n//   issues: [\n//     {\n//       expected: 'string',\n//       code: 'invalid_type',\n//       path: [],\n//       message: 'Not a string!'   <-- 👀 custom error message\n//     }\n//   ]\n// }\n\nAll z functions and schema methods accept custom errors.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nz.string(\"Bad!\");\nz.string().min(5, \"Too short!\");\nz.uuid(\"Bad UUID!\");\nz.iso.date(\"Bad date!\");\nz.array(z.string(), \"Not an array!\");\nz.array(z.string()).min(5, \"Too few items!\");\nz.set(z.string(), \"Bad set!\");\n\nIf you prefer, you can pass a params object with an error parameter instead.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nz.string({ error: \"Bad!\" });\nz.string().min(5, { error: \"Too short!\" });\nz.uuid({ error: \"Bad UUID!\" });\nz.iso.date({ error: \"Bad date!\" });\nz.array(z.string(), { error: \"Bad array!\" });\nz.array(z.string()).min(5, { error: \"Too few items!\" });\nz.set(z.string(), { error: \"Bad set!\" });\n\nThe error param optionally accepts a function. An error customization function is known as an error map in Zod terminology. The error map will run at parse time if a validation error occurs.\n\nz.string({ error: ()=>`[${Date.now()}]: Validation failure.` });\n\nNote — In Zod v3, there were separate params for message (a string) and errorMap (a function). These have been unified in Zod 4 as error.\n\nThe error map receives a context object you can use to customize the error message based on the validation issue.\n\nz.string({\n  error: (iss) => iss.input === undefined ? \"Field is required.\" : \"Invalid input.\"\n});\n\nFor advanced cases, the iss object provides additional information you can use to customize the error.\n\nz.string({\n  error: (iss) => {\n    iss.code; // the issue code\n    iss.input; // the input data\n    iss.inst; // the schema/check that originated this issue\n    iss.path; // the path of the error\n  },\n});\n\nDepending on the API you are using, there may be additional properties available. Use TypeScript's autocomplete to explore the available properties.\n\nz.string().min(5, {\n  error: (iss) => {\n    // ...the same as above\n    iss.minimum; // the minimum value\n    iss.inclusive; // whether the minimum is inclusive\n    return `Password must have ${iss.minimum} characters or more`;\n  },\n});\n\nReturn undefined to avoid customizing the error message and fall back to the default message. (More specifically, Zod will yield control to the next error map in the precedence chain.) This is useful for selectively customizing certain error messages but not others.\n\nz.int64({\n  error: (issue) => {\n    // override too_big error message\n    if (issue.code === \"too_big\") {\n      return { message: `Value must be <${issue.maximum}` };\n    }\n \n    //  defer to default\n    return undefined;\n  },\n});\nPer-parse error customization\n\nTo customize errors on a per-parse basis, pass an error map into the parse method:\n\nconst schema = z.string();\n \nschema.parse(12, {\n  error: iss => \"per-parse custom error\"\n});\n\nThis has lower precedence than any schema-level custom messages.\n\nconst schema = z.string({ error: \"highest priority\" });\nconst result = schema.safeParse(12, {\n  error: (iss) => \"lower priority\",\n});\n \nresult.error.issues;\n// [{ message: \"highest priority\", ... }]\n\nThe iss object is a discriminated union of all possible issue types. Use the code property to discriminate between them.\n\nFor a breakdown of all Zod issue codes, see the zod/v4/core documentation.\n\nconst result = schema.safeParse(12, {\n  error: (iss) => {\n    if (iss.code === \"invalid_type\") {\n      return `invalid type, expected ${iss.expected}`;\n    }\n    if (iss.code === \"too_small\") {\n      return `minimum is ${iss.minimum}`;\n    }\n    // ...\n  }\n});\nInclude input in issues\n\nBy default, Zod does not include input data in issues. This is to prevent unintentional logging of potentially sensitive input data. To include the input data in each issue, use the reportInput flag:\n\nz.string().parse(12, {\n  reportInput: true\n})\n \n// ZodError: [\n//   {\n//     \"expected\": \"string\",\n//     \"code\": \"invalid_type\",\n//     \"input\": 12, // 👀\n//     \"path\": [],\n//     \"message\": \"Invalid input: expected string, received number\"\n//   }\n// ]\nGlobal error customization\n\nTo specify a global error map, use z.config() to set Zod's customError configuration setting:\n\nz.config({\n  customError: (iss) => {\n    return \"globally modified error\";\n  },\n});\n\nGlobal error messages have lower precedence than schema-level or per-parse error messages.\n\nThe iss object is a discriminated union of all possible issue types. Use the code property to discriminate between them.\n\nFor a breakdown of all Zod issue codes, see the zod/v4/core documentation.\n\nconst result = schema.safeParse(12, {\n  error: (iss) => {\n    if (iss.code === \"invalid_type\") {\n      return `invalid type, expected ${iss.expected}`;\n    }\n    if (iss.code === \"too_small\") {\n      return `minimum is ${iss.minimum}`;\n    }\n    // ...\n  }\n})\nInternationalization\n\nTo support internationalization of error message, Zod provides several built-in locales. These are exported from the zod/v4/core package.\n\nNote — The regular zod library automatically loads the en locale automatically. Zod Mini does not load any locale by default; instead all error messages default to Invalid input.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\nimport { en } from \"zod/locales\"\n \nz.config(en());\n\nTo lazily load a locale, consider dynamic imports:\n\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n \nasync function loadLocale(locale: string) {\n  const { default: locale } = await import(`zod/v4/locales/${locale}.js`);\n  z.config(locale());\n};\n \nawait loadLocale(\"fr\");\n\nFor convenience, all locales are exported as z.locales from \"zod\". In some bundlers, this may not be tree-shakable.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n \nz.config(z.locales.en());\nLocales\n\nThe following locales are available:\n\nar — Arabic\naz — Azerbaijani\nbe — Belarusian\nbg — Bulgarian\nca — Catalan\ncs — Czech\nda — Danish\nde — German\nen — English\neo — Esperanto\nes — Spanish\nfa — Farsi\nfi — Finnish\nfr — French\nfrCA — Canadian French\nhe — Hebrew\nhu — Hungarian\nid — Indonesian\nis — Icelandic\nit — Italian\nja — Japanese\nka — Georgian\nkm — Khmer\nko — Korean\nlt — Lithuanian\nmk — Macedonian\nms — Malay\nnl — Dutch\nno — Norwegian\nota — Türkî\nps — Pashto\npl — Polish\npt — Portuguese\nru — Russian\nsl — Slovenian\nsv — Swedish\nta — Tamil\nth — Thai\ntr — Türkçe\nuk — Ukrainian\nur — Urdu\nvi — Tiếng Việt\nzhCN — Simplified Chinese\nzhTW — Traditional Chinese\nyo — Yorùbá\nError precedence\n\nBelow is a quick reference for determining error precedence: if multiple error customizations have been defined, which one takes priority? From highest to lowest priority:\n\nSchema-level error — Any error message \"hard coded\" into a schema definition.\nz.string(\"Not a string!\");\nPer-parse error — A custom error map passed into the .parse() method.\nz.string().parse(12, {\n  error: (iss) => \"My custom error\"\n});\nGlobal error map — A custom error map passed into z.config().\nz.config({\n  customError: (iss) => \"My custom error\"\n});\nLocale error map — A custom error map passed into z.config().\nz.config(z.locales.en());\n\nDefining schemas\n\nComplete API reference for all Zod schema types, methods, and validation features\n\nFormatting errors\n\nUtilities for formatting and displaying Zod errors"

    "html": "Metadata and registries\nCopy markdown\nEdit this page\n\nIt's often useful to associate a schema with some additional metadata for documentation, code generation, AI structured outputs, form validation, and other purposes.\n\nRegistries\n\nMetadata in Zod is handled via registries. Registries are collections of schemas, each associated with some strongly-typed metadata. To create a simple registry:\n\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n \nconst myRegistry = z.registry<{ description: string }>();\n\nTo register, lookup, and remove schemas from this registry:\n\nconst mySchema = z.string();\n \nmyRegistry.add(mySchema, { description: \"A cool schema!\"});\nmyRegistry.has(mySchema); // => true\nmyRegistry.get(mySchema); // => { description: \"A cool schema!\" }\nmyRegistry.remove(mySchema);\nmyRegistry.clear(); // wipe registry\n\nTypeScript enforces that the metadata for each schema matches the registry's metadata type.\n\nmyRegistry.add(mySchema, { description: \"A cool schema!\" }); // ✅\nmyRegistry.add(mySchema, { description: 123 }); // ❌\n\nSpecial handling for id — Zod registries treat the id property specially. An Error will be thrown if multiple schemas are registered with the same id value. This is true for all registries, including the global registry.\n\n.register()\n\nNote — This method is special in that it does not return a new schema; instead, it returns the original schema. No other Zod method does this! That includes .meta() and .describe() (documented below) which return a new instance.\n\nSchemas provide a .register() method to more conveniently add it to a registry.\n\nconst mySchema = z.string();\n \nmySchema.register(myRegistry, { description: \"A cool schema!\" });\n// => mySchema\n\nThis lets you define metadata \"inline\" in your schemas.\n\nconst mySchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string().register(myRegistry, { description: \"The user's name\" }),\n  age: z.number().register(myRegistry, { description: \"The user's age\" }),\n})\n\nIf a registry is defined without a metadata type, you can use it as a generic \"collection\", no metadata required.\n\nconst myRegistry = z.registry();\n \nmyRegistry.add(z.string());\nmyRegistry.add(z.number());\nMetadata\nz.globalRegistry\n\nFor convenience, Zod provides a global registry (z.globalRegistry) that can be used to store metadata for JSON Schema generation or other purposes. It accepts the following metadata:\n\nexport interface GlobalMeta {\n  id?: string ;\n  title?: string ;\n  description?: string;\n  deprecated?: boolean;\n  [k: string]: unknown;\n}\n\nTo register some metadata in z.globalRegistry for a schema:\n\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n \nconst emailSchema = z.email().register(z.globalRegistry, { \n  id: \"email_address\",\n  title: \"Email address\",\n  description: \"Your email address\",\n  examples: [\"first.last@example.com\"]\n});\n\nTo globally augment the GlobalMeta interface, use declaration merging. Add the following anywhere in your codebase. Creating a zod.d.ts file in your project root is a common convention.\n\ndeclare module \"zod\" {\n  interface GlobalMeta {\n    // add new fields here\n    examples?: unknown[];\n  }\n}\n.meta()\n\nFor a more convenient approach, use the .meta() method to register a schema in z.globalRegistry.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst emailSchema = z.email().meta({ \n  id: \"email_address\",\n  title: \"Email address\",\n  description: \"Please enter a valid email address\",\n});\n\nCalling .meta() without an argument will retrieve the metadata for a schema.\n\nemailSchema.meta();\n// => { id: \"email_address\", title: \"Email address\", ... }\n\nMetadata is associated with a specific schema instance. This is important to keep in mind, especially since Zod methods are immutable—they always return a new instance.\n\nconst A = z.string().meta({ description: \"A cool string\" });\nA.meta(); // => { description: \"A cool string\" }\n \nconst B = A.refine(_ => true);\nB.meta(); // => undefined\n.describe()\n\nThe .describe() method still exists for compatibility with Zod 3, but .meta() is now the recommended approach.\n\nThe .describe() method is a shorthand for registering a schema in z.globalRegistry with just a description field.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst emailSchema = z.email();\nemailSchema.describe(\"An email address\");\n \n// equivalent to\nemailSchema.meta({ description: \"An email address\" });\nCustom registries\n\nYou've already seen a simple example of a custom registry:\n\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n \nconst myRegistry = z.registry<{ description: string };>();\n\nLet's look at some more advanced patterns.\n\nReferencing inferred types\n\nIt's often valuable for the metadata type to reference the inferred type of a schema. For instance, you may want an examples field to contain examples of the schema's output.\n\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n \ntype MyMeta = { examples: z.$output[] };\nconst myRegistry = z.registry<MyMeta>();\n \nmyRegistry.add(z.string(), { examples: [\"hello\", \"world\"] });\nmyRegistry.add(z.number(), { examples: [1, 2, 3] });\n\nThe special symbol z.$output is a reference to the schemas inferred output type (z.infer<typeof schema>). Similarly you can use z.$input to reference the input type.\n\nConstraining schema types\n\nPass a second generic to z.registry() to constrain the schema types that can be added to a registry. This registry only accepts string schemas.\n\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n \nconst myRegistry = z.registry<{ description: string }, z.ZodString>();\n \nmyRegistry.add(z.string(), { description: \"A number\" }); // ✅\nmyRegistry.add(z.number(), { description: \"A number\" }); // ❌ \n//             ^ 'ZodNumber' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ZodString' \n\nFormatting errors\n\nUtilities for formatting and displaying Zod errors\n\nJSON Schema\n\nHow to convert Zod schemas to JSON Schema"

The input and output types are identical, so there's no difference between \"forward\" and \"backward\".\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nconst schema = z.string();\n \ntype Input = z.input<typeof schema>;    // string\ntype Output = z.output<typeof schema>;  // string\n \nschema.parse(\"asdf\");   // => \"asdf\"\nschema.decode(\"asdf\");  // => \"asdf\"\nschema.encode(\"asdf\");  // => \"asdf\"\n\nHowever, some schema types cause the input and output types to diverge, notably z.codec(). Codecs are a special type of schema that defines a bi-directional transformation between two other schemas.\n\nconst stringToDate = z.codec(\n  z.iso.datetime(),  // input schema: ISO date string\n  z.date(),          // output schema: Date object\n  {\n    decode: (isoString) => new Date(isoString), // ISO string → Date\n    encode: (date) => date.toISOString(),       // Date → ISO string\n  }\n);\n\nIn these cases, z.decode() and z.encode() behave quite differently.\n\nZod\nZod Mini\nstringToDate.decode(\"2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z\")\n// => Date\n \nstringToDate.encode(new Date(\"2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z\"))\n// => string\n\nNote —There's nothing special about the directions or terminology here. Instead of encoding with an A -> B codec, you could instead decode with a B -> A codec. The use of the terms \"decode\" and \"encode\" is just a convention.\n\nThis is particularly useful when parsing data at a network boundary. You can share a single Zod schema between your client and server, then use this single schema to convert between a network-friendly format (say, JSON) and a richer JavaScript representation.\n\nComposability\n\nNote — You can use z.encode() and z.decode() with any schema. It doesn't have to be a ZodCodec.\n\nCodecs are a schema like any other. You can nest them inside objects, arrays, pipes, etc. There are no rules on where you can use them!\n\nconst payloadSchema = z.object({ \n  startDate: stringToDate \n});\n \npayloadSchema.decode({\n  startDate: \"2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z\"\n}); // => { startDate: Date }\nType-safe inputs\n\nWhile .parse() and .decode() behave identically at runtime, they have different type signatures. The .parse() method accepts unknown as input, and returns a value that matches the schema's inferred output type. By constrast, the z.decode() and z.encode() functions have strongly-typed inputs.\n\nstringToDate.parse(12345); \n// no complaints from TypeScript (fails at runtime)\n \nstringToDate.decode(12345); \n// ❌ TypeScript error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.\n \nstringToDate.encode(12345); \n// ❌ TypeScript error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Date'.\n\nWhy the difference? Encoding and decoding imply transformation. In many cases, the inputs to these methods Here's a diagram demonstrating the differences between the type signatures for parse(), decode(), and encode().\n\nAsync and safe variants\n\nAs with .transform() and .refine(), codecs support async transforms.\n\nconst asyncCodec = z.codec(z.string(), z.number(), {\n  decode: async (str) => Number(str),\n  encode: async (num) => num.toString(),\n});\n\nAs with regular parse(), there are \"safe\" and \"async\" variants of decode() and encode().\n\nstringToDate.decode(\"2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z\"); \n// => Date\n \nstringToDate.decodeAsync(\"2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z\"); \n// => Promise<Date>\n \nstringToDate.decodeSafe(\"2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z\"); \n// => { success: true, data: Date } | { success: false, error: ZodError }\n \nstringToDate.decodeSafeAsync(\"2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z\"); \n// => Promise<{ success: true, data: Date } | { success: false, error: ZodError }>\nHow encoding works\n\nThere are some subtleties to how certain Zod schemas \"reverse\" their parse behavior.\n\nCodecs\n\nThis one is fairly self-explanatory. Codecs encapsulate a bi-directional transformation between two types. During z.decode(), the decode transform is executed. During z.encode(), the encode transform is executed.\n\nconst stringToDate = z.codec(\n  z.iso.datetime(),  // input schema: ISO date string\n  z.date(),          // output schema: Date object\n  {\n    decode: (isoString) => new Date(isoString), // ISO string → Date\n    encode: (date) => date.toISOString(),       // Date → ISO string\n  }\n);\n \nstringToDate.decode(\"2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z\"); \n// => Date\n \nstringToDate.encode(new Date(\"2024-01-15\")); \n// => string\nPipes\n\nFun fact — Codecs are actually implemented internally as subclass of pipes that have been augmented with \"interstitial\" transform logic.\n\nDuring regular decoding, a ZodPipe<A, B> schema will first parse the data with A, then pass it into B. As you might expect, during encoding, the data is first encoded with B, then passed into A.\n\nRefinements\n\nAll checks (.refine(), .min(), .max(), etc.) are still executed in both directions.\n\nconst schema = stringToDate.refine((date) => date.getFullYear() >= 2000, \"Must be this millenium\");\n \nschema.encode(new Date(\"2000-01-01\"));\n// => Date\n \nschema.encode(new Date(\"1999-01-01\"));\n// => ❌ ZodError: [\n//   {\n//     \"code\": \"custom\",\n//     \"path\": [],\n//     \"message\": \"Must be this millenium\"\n//   }\n// ]\n\nTo avoid unexpected errors in your custom .refine() logic, Zod performs two \"passes\" during z.encode(). The first pass ensures the input type conforms to the expected type (no invalid_type errors). If that passes, Zod performs the second pass which executes the refinement logic.\n\nThis approach also supports \"mutating transforms\" like z.string().trim() or z.string().toLowerCase():\n\nconst schema = z.string().trim();\n \nschema.decode(\"  hello  \");\n// => \"hello\"\n \nschema.encode(\"  hello  \");\n// => \"hello\"\nDefaults and prefaults\n\nDefaults and prefaults are only applied in the \"forward\" direction.\n\nconst stringWithDefault = z.string().default(\"hello\");\n \nstringWithDefault.decode(undefined); \n// => \"hello\"\n \nstringWithDefault.encode(undefined); \n// => ZodError: Expected string, received undefined\n\nWhen you attach a default value to a schema, the input becomes optional (| undefined) but the output does not. As such, undefined is not a valid input to z.encode() and defaults/prefaults will not be applied.\n\nCatch\n\nSimilarly, .catch() is only applied in the \"forward\" direction.\n\nconst stringWithCatch = z.string().catch(\"hello\");\n \nstringWithCatch.decode(1234); \n// => \"hello\"\n \nstringWithCatch.encode(1234); \n// => ZodError: Expected string, received number\nStringbool\n\nNote — Stringbool pre-dates the introduction of codecs in Zod. It has since been internally re-implemented as a codec.\n\nThe z.stringbool() API converts string values (\"true\", \"false\", \"yes\", \"no\", etc.) into boolean. By default, it will convert true to \"true\" and false to \"false\" during z.encode()..\n\nconst stringbool = z.stringbool();\n \nstringbool.decode(\"true\");  // => true\nstringbool.decode(\"false\"); // => false\n \nstringbool.encode(true);    // => \"true\"\nstringbool.encode(false);   // => \"false\"\n\nIf you specify a custom set of truthy and falsy values, the first element in the array will be used instead.\n\nconst stringbool = z.stringbool({ truthy: [\"yes\", \"y\"], falsy: [\"no\", \"n\"] });\n \nstringbool.encode(true);    // => \"yes\"\nstringbool.encode(false);   // => \"no\"\nTransforms\n\n⚠️ — The .transform() API implements a unidirectional transformation. If any .transform() exists anywhere in your schema, attempting a z.encode() operation will throw a runtime error (not a ZodError).\n\nconst schema = z.string().transform(val => val.length);\n \nschema.encode(1234); \n// ❌ Error: Encountered unidirectional transform during encode: ZodTransform\nUseful codecs\n\nBelow are implementations for a bunch of commonly-needed codecs. For the sake of customizability, these are not included as first-class APIs in Zod itself. Instead, you should copy/paste them into your project and modify them as needed.\n\nNote — All of these codec implementations have been tested for correctness.\n\nstringToNumber\n\nConverts string representations of numbers to JavaScript number type using parseFloat().\n\nconst stringToNumber = z.codec(z.string().regex(z.regexes.number), z.number(), {\n  decode: (str) => Number.parseFloat(str),\n  encode: (num) => num.toString(),\n});\n \nstringToNumber.decode(\"42.5\");  // => 42.5\nstringToNumber.encode(42.5);    // => \"42.5\"\nstringToInt\n\nConverts string representations of integers to JavaScript number type using parseInt().\n\nconst stringToInt = z.codec(z.string().regex(z.regexes.integer), z.int(), {\n  decode: (str) => Number.parseInt(str, 10),\n  encode: (num) => num.toString(),\n});\n \nstringToInt.decode(\"42\");  // => 42\nstringToInt.encode(42);    // => \"42\"\nstringToBigInt\n\nConverts string representations to JavaScript bigint type.\n\nconst stringToBigInt = z.codec(z.string(), z.bigint(), {\n  decode: (str) => BigInt(str),\n  encode: (bigint) => bigint.toString(),\n});\n \nstringToBigInt.decode(\"12345\");  // => 12345n\nstringToBigInt.encode(12345n);   // => \"12345\"\nnumberToBigInt\n\nConverts JavaScript number to bigint type.\n\nconst numberToBigInt = z.codec(z.int(), z.bigint(), {\n  decode: (num) => BigInt(num),\n  encode: (bigint) => Number(bigint),\n});\n \nnumberToBigInt.decode(42);   // => 42n\nnumberToBigInt.encode(42n);  // => 42\nisoDatetimeToDate\n\nConverts ISO datetime strings to JavaScript Date objects.\n\nconst isoDatetimeToDate = z.codec(z.iso.datetime(), z.date(), {\n  decode: (isoString) => new Date(isoString),\n  encode: (date) => date.toISOString(),\n});\n \nisoDatetimeToDate.decode(\"2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z\");  // => Date object\nisoDatetimeToDate.encode(new Date(\"2024-01-15\"));       // => \"2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z\"\nepochSecondsToDate\n\nConverts Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch) to JavaScript Date objects.\n\nconst epochSecondsToDate = z.codec(z.int().min(0), z.date(), {\n  decode: (seconds) => new Date(seconds * 1000),\n  encode: (date) => Math.floor(date.getTime() / 1000),\n});\n \nepochSecondsToDate.decode(1705314600);  // => Date object\nepochSecondsToDate.encode(new Date());  // => Unix timestamp in seconds\nepochMillisToDate\n\nConverts Unix timestamps (milliseconds since epoch) to JavaScript Date objects.\n\nconst epochMillisToDate = z.codec(z.int().min(0), z.date(), {\n  decode: (millis) => new Date(millis),\n  encode: (date) => date.getTime(),\n});\n \nepochMillisToDate.decode(1705314600000);  // => Date object\nepochMillisToDate.encode(new Date());     // => Unix timestamp in milliseconds\njson(schema)\n\nParses JSON strings into structured data and serializes back to JSON. This generic function accepts an output schema to validate the parsed JSON data.\n\nconst jsonCodec = <T extends z.core.$ZodType>(schema: T) =>\n  z.codec(z.string(), schema, {\n    decode: (jsonString, ctx) => {\n      try {\n        return JSON.parse(jsonString);\n      } catch (err: any) {\n        ctx.issues.push({\n          code: \"invalid_format\",\n          format: \"json\",\n          input: jsonString,\n          message: err.message,\n        });\n        return z.NEVER;\n      }\n    },\n    encode: (value) => JSON.stringify(value),\n  });\n\nUsage example with a specific schema:\n\nconst jsonToObject = jsonCodec(z.object({ name: z.string(), age: z.number() }));\n \njsonToObject.decode('{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"age\":30}');  \n// => { name: \"Alice\", age: 30 }\n \njsonToObject.encode({ name: \"Bob\", age: 25 });     \n// => '{\"name\":\"Bob\",\"age\":25}'\n \njsonToObject.decode('~~invalid~~'); \n// ZodError: [\n//   {\n//     \"code\": \"invalid_format\",\n//     \"format\": \"json\",\n//     \"path\": [],\n//     \"message\": \"Unexpected token '~', \\\"~~invalid~~\\\" is not valid JSON\"\n//   }\n// ]\nutf8ToBytes\n\nConverts UTF-8 strings to Uint8Array byte arrays.\n\nconst utf8ToBytes = z.codec(z.string(), z.instanceof(Uint8Array), {\n  decode: (str) => new TextEncoder().encode(str),\n  encode: (bytes) => new TextDecoder().decode(bytes),\n});\n \nutf8ToBytes.decode(\"Hello, 世界!\");  // => Uint8Array\nutf8ToBytes.encode(bytes);          // => \"Hello, 世界!\"\nbytesToUtf8\n\nConverts Uint8Array byte arrays to UTF-8 strings.\n\nconst bytesToUtf8 = z.codec(z.instanceof(Uint8Array), z.string(), {\n  decode: (bytes) => new TextDecoder().decode(bytes),\n  encode: (str) => new TextEncoder().encode(str),\n});\n \nbytesToUtf8.decode(bytes);          // => \"Hello, 世界!\"\nbytesToUtf8.encode(\"Hello, 世界!\");  // => Uint8Array\nbase64ToBytes\n\nConverts base64 strings to Uint8Array byte arrays and vice versa.\n\nconst base64ToBytes = z.codec(z.base64(), z.instanceof(Uint8Array), {\n  decode: (base64String) => z.util.base64ToUint8Array(base64String),\n  encode: (bytes) => z.util.uint8ArrayToBase64(bytes),\n});\n \nbase64ToBytes.decode(\"SGVsbG8=\");  // => Uint8Array([72, 101, 108, 108, 111])\nbase64ToBytes.encode(bytes);       // => \"SGVsbG8=\"\nbase64urlToBytes\n\nConverts base64url strings (URL-safe base64) to Uint8Array byte arrays.\n\nconst base64urlToBytes = z.codec(z.base64url(), z.instanceof(Uint8Array), {\n  decode: (base64urlString) => z.util.base64urlToUint8Array(base64urlString),\n  encode: (bytes) => z.util.uint8ArrayToBase64url(bytes),\n});\n \nbase64urlToBytes.decode(\"SGVsbG8\");  // => Uint8Array([72, 101, 108, 108, 111])\nbase64urlToBytes.encode(bytes);      // => \"SGVsbG8\"\nhexToBytes\n\nConverts hexadecimal strings to Uint8Array byte arrays and vice versa.\n\nconst hexToBytes = z.codec(z.hex(), z.instanceof(Uint8Array), {\n  decode: (hexString) => z.util.hexToUint8Array(hexString),\n  encode: (bytes) => z.util.uint8ArrayToHex(bytes),\n});\n \nhexToBytes.decode(\"48656c6c6f\");     // => Uint8Array([72, 101, 108, 108, 111])\nhexToBytes.encode(bytes);            // => \"48656c6c6f\"\nstringToURL\n\nConverts URL strings to JavaScript URL objects.\n\nconst stringToURL = z.codec(z.url(), z.instanceof(URL), {\n  decode: (urlString) => new URL(urlString),\n  encode: (url) => url.href,\n});\n \nstringToURL.decode(\"https://example.com/path\");  // => URL object\nstringToURL.encode(new URL(\"https://example.com\"));  // => \"https://example.com/\"\nstringToHttpURL\n\nConverts HTTP/HTTPS URL strings to JavaScript URL objects.\n\nconst stringToHttpURL = z.codec(z.httpUrl(), z.instanceof(URL), {\n  decode: (urlString) => new URL(urlString),\n  encode: (url) => url.href,\n});\n \nstringToHttpURL.decode(\"https://api.example.com/v1\");  // => URL object\nstringToHttpURL.encode(url);                           // => \"https://api.example.com/v1\"\nuriComponent\n\nEncodes and decodes URI components using encodeURIComponent() and decodeURIComponent().\n\nconst uriComponent = z.codec(z.string(), z.string(), {\n  decode: (encodedString) => decodeURIComponent(encodedString),\n  encode: (decodedString) => encodeURIComponent(decodedString),\n});\n \nuriComponent.decode(\"Hello%20World%21\");  // => \"Hello World!\"\nuriComponent.encode(\"Hello World!\");      // => \"Hello%20World!\"\n\nJSON Schema\n\nHow to convert Zod schemas to JSON Schema\n\nEcosystem\n\nOverview of the Zod ecosystem including integrations, tools, and community resources"

JSON Schema is a standard for describing the structure of JSON (with JSON). It's widely used in OpenAPI definitions and defining structured outputs for AI.\n\nTo convert a Zod schema to JSON Schema, use the z.toJSONSchema() function.\n\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n \nconst schema = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n  age: z.number(),\n});\n \nz.toJSONSchema(schema)\n// => {\n//   type: 'object',\n//   properties: { name: { type: 'string' }, age: { type: 'number' } },\n//   required: [ 'name', 'age' ],\n//   additionalProperties: false,\n// }\n\nAll schema & checks are converted to their closest JSON Schema equivalent. Some types have no analog and cannot be reasonably represented.

If you are trying to define custom behavior for an unrepresentable type, you'll need to use set the unrepresentable: \"any\" alongside override.\n\n// support z.date() as ISO datetime strings\nconst result = z.toJSONSchema(z.date(), {\n  unrepresentable: \"any\",\n  override: (ctx) => {\n    const def = ctx.zodSchema._zod.def;\n    if(def.type ===\"date\"){\n      ctx.jsonSchema.type = \"string\";\n      ctx.jsonSchema.format = \"date-time\";\n    }\n  },\n});\nio\n\nSome schema types have different input and output types, e.g. ZodPipe, ZodDefault, and coerced primitives. By default, the result of z.toJSONSchema represents the output type; use \"io\": \"input\" to extract the input type instead.\n\nconst mySchema = z.string().transform(val => val.length).pipe(z.number());\n// ZodPipe\n \nconst jsonSchema = z.toJSONSchema(mySchema); \n// => { type: \"number\" }\n \nconst jsonSchema = z.toJSONSchema(mySchema, { io: \"input\" }); \n// => { type: \"string\" }\nRegistries\n\nPassing a schema into z.toJSONSchema() will return a self-contained JSON Schema.\n\nIn other cases, you may have a set of Zod schemas you'd like to represent using multiple interlinked JSON Schemas, perhaps to write to .json files and serve from a web server.\n\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n \nconst User = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n  get posts(){\n    return z.array(Post);\n  }\n});\n \nconst Post = z.object({\n  title: z.string(),\n  content: z.string(),\n  get author(){\n    return User;\n  }\n});\n \nz.globalRegistry.add(User, {id: \"User\"});\nz.globalRegistry.add(Post, {id: \"Post\"});\n\nTo achieve this, you can pass a registry into z.toJSONSchema().\n\nImportant — All schemas should have a registered id property in the registry! Any schemas without an id will be ignored.\n\nz.toJSONSchema(z.globalRegistry);\n// => {\n//   schemas: {\n//     User: {\n//       id: 'User',\n//       type: 'object',\n//       properties: {\n//         name: { type: 'string' },\n//         posts: { type: 'array', items: { '$ref': 'Post' } }\n//       },\n//       required: [ 'name', 'posts' ],\n//       additionalProperties: false,\n//     },\n//     Post: {\n//       id: 'Post',\n//       type: 'object',\n//       properties: {\n//         title: { type: 'string' },\n//         content: { type: 'string' },\n//         author: { '$ref': 'User' }\n//       },\n//       required: [ 'title', 'content', 'author' ],\n//       additionalProperties: false,\n//     }\n//   }\n// }\n\nBy default, the $ref URIs are simple relative paths like \"User\". To make these absolute URIs, use the uri option. This expects a function that converts an id to a fully-qualified URI.\n\nz.toJSONSchema(z.globalRegistry, {\n  uri: (id) => `https://example.com/${id}.json`\n});\n// => {\n//   schemas: {\n//     User: {\n//       id: 'User',\n//       type: 'object',\n//       properties: {\n//         name: { type: 'string' },\n//         posts: {\n//           type: 'array',\n//           items: { '$ref': 'https://example.com/Post.json' }\n//         }\n//       },\n//       required: [ 'name', 'posts' ],\n//       additionalProperties: false,\n//     },\n//     Post: {\n//       id: 'Post',\n//       type: 'object',\n//       properties: {\n//         title: { type: 'string' },\n//         content: { type: 'string' },\n//         author: { '$ref': 'https://example.com/User.json' }\n//       },\n//       required: [ 'title', 'content', 'author' ],\n//       additionalProperties: false,\n//     }\n//   }\n// }\n\nMetadata and registries\n\nAttaching and manipulatinvg metadata on Zod schemas\n\nCodecs\n\nBidirectional transformations with encode and decode"

    "html": "Zod Mini\nCopy markdown\nEdit this page\n\nNote — The docs for Zod Mini are interleaved with the regular Zod docs via tabbed code blocks. This page is designed to explain why Zod Mini exists, when to use it, and some key differences from regular Zod.\n\nZod Mini variant was introduced with the release of Zod 4. To try it:\n\nnpm install zod@^4.0.0\n\nTo import it:\n\nimport * as z from \"zod/mini\";\n\nZod Mini implements the exact same functionality as zod, but using a functional, tree-shakable API. If you're coming from zod, this means you generally will use functions in place of methods.\n\n// regular Zod\nconst mySchema = z.string().optional().nullable();\n \n// Zod Mini\nconst mySchema = z.nullable(z.optional(z.string()));\nTree-shaking\n\nTree-shaking is a technique used by modern bundlers to remove unused code from the final bundle. It's also referred to as dead-code elimination.\n\nIn regular Zod, schemas provide a range of convenience methods to perform some common operations (e.g. .min() on string schemas). Bundlers are generally not able to remove (\"treeshake\") unused method implementations from your bundle, but they are able to remove unused top-level functions. As such, the API of Zod Mini uses more functions than methods.\n\n// regular Zod\nz.string().min(5).max(10).trim()\n \n// Zod Mini\nz.string().check(z.minLength(5), z.maxLength(10), z.trim());\n\nTo give a general idea about the bundle size reduction, consider this simple script:\n\nz.boolean().parse(true)\n\nBundling this with Zod and Zod Mini results in the following bundle sizes. Zod Mini results in a 64% reduction.\n\nPackage\tBundle size (gzip)\nZod Mini\t2.12kb\nZod\t5.91kb\n\nWith a marginally more complex schema that involves object types:\n\nconst schema = z.object({ a: z.string(), b: z.number(), c: z.boolean() });\n \nschema.parse({\n  a: \"asdf\",\n  b: 123,\n  c: true,\n});\nPackage\tBundle size (gzip)\nZod Mini\t4.0kb\nZod\t13.1kb\n\nThis gives you a sense of the bundle sizes involved. Look closely at these numbers and run your own benchmarks to determine if using Zod Mini is worth it for your use case.\n\nWhen (not) to use Zod Mini\n\nIn general you should probably use regular Zod unless you have uncommonly strict constraints around bundle size. Many developers massively overestimate the importance of bundle size to application performance. In practice, bundle size on the scale of Zod (5-10kb typically) is only a meaningful concern when optimizing front-end bundles for a user base with slow mobile network connections in rural or developing areas.\n\nLet's run through some considerations:\n\nDX\n\nThe API of Zod Mini is more verbose and less discoverable. The methods in Zod's API are much easier to discover & autocomplete through Intellisense than the top-level functions in Zod Mini. It isn't possible to quickly build a schema with chained APIs. (Speaking as the creator of Zod: I spent a lot of time designing the Zod Mini API to be as ergonomic as possible, but I still have a strong preference the standard Zod API.)\n\nBackend development\n\nIf you are using Zod on the backend, bundle size on the scale of Zod is not meaningful. This is true even in resource-constrained environments like Lambda. This post benchmarks cold start times with bundles of various sizes. Here is a subset of the results:\n\nBundle size\tLambda cold start time\n1kb\t171ms\n17kb (size of gzipped non-Mini Zod)\t171.6ms (interpolated)\n128kb\t176ms\n256kb\t182ms\n512kb\t279ms\n1mb\t557ms\n\nThe minimum cold start time for a negligible 1kb bundle is 171ms. The next bundle size tested is 128kb, which added only 5ms. When gzipped, the bundle size for the entirely of regular Zod is roughly 17kb, which would correspond to a 0.6ms increase in startup time.\n\nInternet speed\n\nGenerally, the round trip time to the server (100-200ms) will dwarf the time required to download an additional 10kb. Only on slow 3G connections (sub-1Mbps) does the download time for an additional 10kb become more significant. If you aren't optimizing specifically for users in rural or developing areas, your time is likely better spent optimizing something else.\n\nZodMiniType\n\nAll Zod Mini schemas extend the z.ZodMiniType base class, which in turn extends z.core.$ZodType from zod/v4/core. While this class implements far fewer methods than ZodType in zod, some particularly useful methods remain.\n\n.parse\n\nThis is an obvious one. All Zod Mini schemas implement the same parsing methods as zod.\n\nimport * as z from \"zod/mini\"\n \nconst mySchema = z.string();\n \nmySchema.parse('asdf')\nawait mySchema.parseAsync('asdf')\nmySchema.safeParse('asdf')\nawait mySchema.safeParseAsync('asdf')\n.check()\n\nIn regular Zod there are dedicated methods on schema subclasses for performing common checks:\n\nimport * as z from \"zod\";\n \nz.string()\n  .min(5)\n  .max(10)\n  .refine(val => val.includes(\"@\"))\n  .trim()\n\nIn Zod Mini such methods aren't implemented. Instead you pass these checks into schemas using the .check() method:\n\nimport * as z from \"zod/mini\"\n \nz.string().check(\n  z.minLength(5), \n  z.maxLength(10),\n  z.refine(val => val.includes(\"@\")),\n  z.trim()\n);\n\nThe following checks are implemented. Some of these checks only apply to schemas of certain types (e.g. strings or numbers). The APIs are all type-safe; TypeScript won't let you add an unsupported check to your schema.\n\nz.lt(value);\nz.lte(value); // alias: z.maximum()\nz.gt(value);\nz.gte(value); // alias: z.minimum()\nz.positive();\nz.negative();\nz.nonpositive();\nz.nonnegative();\nz.multipleOf(value);\nz.maxSize(value);\nz.minSize(value);\nz.size(value);\nz.maxLength(value);\nz.minLength(value);\nz.length(value);\nz.regex(regex);\nz.lowercase();\nz.uppercase();\nz.includes(value);\nz.startsWith(value);\nz.endsWith(value);\nz.property(key, schema);\nz.mime(value);\n \n// custom checks\nz.refine()\nz.check()   // replaces .superRefine()\n \n// mutations (these do not change the inferred types)\nz.overwrite(value => newValue);\nz.normalize();\nz.trim();\nz.toLowerCase();\nz.toUpperCase();\n.register()\n\nFor registering a schema in a registry.\n\nconst myReg = z.registry<{title: string}>();\n \nz.string().register(myReg, { title: \"My cool string schema\" });\n.brand()\n\nFor branding a schema. Refer to the Branded types docs for more information.\n\nimport * as z from \"zod/mini\"\n \nconst USD = z.string().brand(\"USD\");\n.clone(def)\n\nReturns an identical clone of the current schema using the provided def.\n\nconst mySchema = z.string()\n \nmySchema.clone(mySchema._zod.def);\nNo default locale\n\nWhile regular Zod automatically loads the English (en) locale, Zod Mini does not. This reduces the bundle size in scenarios where error messages are unnecessary, localized to a non-English language, or otherwise customized.\n\nThis means, by default the message property of all issues will simply read \"Invalid input\". To load the English locale:\n\nimport * as z from \"zod/mini\"\n \nz.config(z.locales.en());\n\nRefer to the Locales docs for more on localization.\n\nZod\n\nInternals and structure of the Zod library\n\nZod Core\n\nZod Core package - minimal core functionality for custom implementations"

This property is an object containing the schemas internals. The goal is to make zod/v4/core as extensible and unopinionated as possible. Other libraries can \"build their own Zod\" on top of these classes without zod/v4/core cluttering up the interface. Refer to the implementations of zod and zod/mini for examples of how to extend these classes.\n\nThe _zod internals property contains some notable properties:\n\n.def — The schema's definition: this is the object you pass into the class's constructor to create an instance. It completely describes the schema, and it's JSON-serializable.\n.def.type — A string representing the schema's type, e.g. \"string\", \"object\", \"array\", etc.\n.def.checks — An array of checks that are executed by the schema after parsing.\n.input — A virtual property that \"stores\" the schema's inferred input type.\n.output — A virtual property that \"stores\" the schema's inferred output type.\n.run() — The schema's internal parser implementation.\n\nIf you are implementing a tool (say, a code generator) that must traverse Zod schemas, you can cast any schema to $ZodTypes and use the def property to discriminate between these classes.\n\nexport function walk(_schema: z.$ZodType) {\n  const schema = _schema as z.$ZodTypes;\n  const def = schema._zod.def;\n  switch (def.type) {\n    case \"string\": {\n      // ...\n      break;\n    }\n    case \"object\": {\n      // ...\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThere are a number of subclasses of $ZodString that implement various string formats.

That's because these classes implement both the $ZodCheck and $ZodType interfaces. That is, they can be used as either a check or a type. In these cases, both ._zod.parse (the schema parser) and ._zod.check (the check validation) are executed during parsing. In effect, the instance is prepended to its own checks array (though it won't actually exist in ._zod.def.checks).\n\n// as a type\nz.email().parse(\"user@example.com\");\n \n// as a check\nz.string().check(z.email()).parse(\"user@example.com\")\nErrors\n\nThe base class for all errors in Zod is $ZodError.\n\nFor performance reasons, $ZodError does not extend the built-in Error class! So using instanceof Error will return false.\n\nThe zod package implements a subclass of $ZodError called ZodError with some additional convenience methods.\nThe zod/mini sub-package directly uses $ZodError\nexport class $ZodError<T = unknown> implements Error {\n public issues: $ZodIssue[];\n}\nIssues\n\nThe issues property corresponds to an array of $ZodIssue objects. All issues extend the z.$ZodIssueBase interface.\n\nexport interface $ZodIssueBase {\n  readonly code?: string;\n  readonly input?: unknown;\n  readonly path: PropertyKey[];\n  readonly message: string;\n}\n\nZod defines the following issue subtypes:\n\nexport type $ZodIssue =\n  | $ZodIssueInvalidType\n  | $ZodIssueTooBig\n  | $ZodIssueTooSmall\n  | $ZodIssueInvalidStringFormat\n  | $ZodIssueNotMultipleOf\n  | $ZodIssueUnrecognizedKeys\n  | $ZodIssueInvalidUnion\n  | $ZodIssueInvalidKey\n  | $ZodIssueInvalidElement\n  | $ZodIssueInvalidValue\n  | $ZodIssueCustom;\n\nFor details on each type, refer to the implementation.\n\nZod Mini\n\nZod Mini - a tree-shakable Zod"

    "html": "API REFERENCE\nBuilt-in React Hooks\n\nHooks let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in Hooks or combine them to build your own. This page lists all built-in Hooks in React.\n\nState Hooks \n\nState lets a component “remember” information like user input. For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index.\n\nTo add state to a component, use one of these Hooks:\n\nuseState declares a state variable that you can update directly.\nuseReducer declares a state variable with the update logic inside a reducer function.\nfunction ImageGallery() {\n\n  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);\n\n  // ...\nContext Hooks \n\nContext lets a component receive information from distant parents without passing it as props. For example, your app’s top-level component can pass the current UI theme to all components below, no matter how deep.\n\nuseContext reads and subscribes to a context.\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  // ...\nRef Hooks \n\nRefs let a component hold some information that isn’t used for rendering, like a DOM node or a timeout ID. Unlike with state, updating a ref does not re-render your component. Refs are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. They are useful when you need to work with non-React systems, such as the built-in browser APIs.\n\nuseRef declares a ref. You can hold any value in it, but most often it’s used to hold a DOM node.\nuseImperativeHandle lets you customize the ref exposed by your component. This is rarely used.\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  // ...\nEffect Hooks \n\nEffects let a component connect to and synchronize with external systems. This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code.\n\nuseEffect connects a component to an external system.\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n\nEffects are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. Don’t use Effects to orchestrate the data flow of your application. If you’re not interacting with an external system, you might not need an Effect.\n\nThere are two rarely used variations of useEffect with differences in timing:\n\nuseLayoutEffect fires before the browser repaints the screen. You can measure layout here.\nuseInsertionEffect fires before React makes changes to the DOM. Libraries can insert dynamic CSS here.\nPerformance Hooks \n\nA common way to optimize re-rendering performance is to skip unnecessary work. For example, you can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data has not changed since the previous render.\n\nTo skip calculations and unnecessary re-rendering, use one of these Hooks:\n\nuseMemo lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.\nuseCallback lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSometimes, you can’t skip re-rendering because the screen actually needs to update. In that case, you can improve performance by separating blocking updates that must be synchronous (like typing into an input) from non-blocking updates which don’t need to block the user interface (like updating a chart).\n\nTo prioritize rendering, use one of these Hooks:\n\nuseTransition lets you mark a state transition as non-blocking and allow other updates to interrupt it.\nuseDeferredValue lets you defer updating a non-critical part of the UI and let other parts update first.\nOther Hooks \n\nThese Hooks are mostly useful to library authors and aren’t commonly used in the application code.\n\nuseDebugValue lets you customize the label React DevTools displays for your custom Hook.\nuseId lets a component associate a unique ID with itself. Typically used with accessibility APIs.\nuseSyncExternalStore lets a component subscribe to an external store.\nuseActionState allows you to manage state of actions.\nYour own Hooks \n\nYou can also define your own custom Hooks as JavaScript functions.\n\nPREVIOUS\nOverview\nNEXT\nuseActionState"

    "html": "API REFERENCE\nHOOKS\nuseActionState\n\nuseActionState is a Hook that allows you to update state based on the result of a form action.\n\nconst [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(fn, initialState, permalink?);\nNote\n\nIn earlier React Canary versions, this API was part of React DOM and called useFormState.\n\nReference\nuseActionState(action, initialState, permalink?)\nUsage\nUsing information returned by a form action\nTroubleshooting\nMy action can no longer read the submitted form data\nReference \nuseActionState(action, initialState, permalink?) \n\nCall useActionState at the top level of your component to create component state that is updated when a form action is invoked. You pass useActionState an existing form action function as well as an initial state, and it returns a new action that you use in your form, along with the latest form state and whether the Action is still pending. The latest form state is also passed to the function that you provided.\n\nimport { useActionState } from \"react\";\n\n\n\nasync function increment(previousState, formData) {\n\n  return previousState + 1;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction StatefulForm({}) {\n\n  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(increment, 0);\n\n  return (\n\n    <form>\n\n      {state}\n\n      <button formAction={formAction}>Increment</button>\n\n    </form>\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nThe form state is the value returned by the action when the form was last submitted. If the form has not yet been submitted, it is the initial state that you pass.\n\nIf used with a Server Function, useActionState allows the server’s response from submitting the form to be shown even before hydration has completed.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \nfn: The function to be called when the form is submitted or button pressed. When the function is called, it will receive the previous state of the form (initially the initialState that you pass, subsequently its previous return value) as its initial argument, followed by the arguments that a form action normally receives.\ninitialState: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be any serializable value. This argument is ignored after the action is first invoked.\noptional permalink: A string containing the unique page URL that this form modifies. For use on pages with dynamic content (eg: feeds) in conjunction with progressive enhancement: if fn is a server function and the form is submitted before the JavaScript bundle loads, the browser will navigate to the specified permalink URL, rather than the current page’s URL. Ensure that the same form component is rendered on the destination page (including the same action fn and permalink) so that React knows how to pass the state through. Once the form has been hydrated, this parameter has no effect.\nReturns \n\nuseActionState returns an array with the following values:\n\nThe current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed. After the action is invoked, it will match the value returned by the action.\nA new action that you can pass as the action prop to your form component or formAction prop to any button component within the form. The action can also be called manually within startTransition.\nThe isPending flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition.\nCaveats \nWhen used with a framework that supports React Server Components, useActionState lets you make forms interactive before JavaScript has executed on the client. When used without Server Components, it is equivalent to component local state.\nThe function passed to useActionState receives an extra argument, the previous or initial state, as its first argument. This makes its signature different than if it were used directly as a form action without using useActionState.\nUsage \nUsing information returned by a form action \n\nCall useActionState at the top level of your component to access the return value of an action from the last time a form was submitted.\n\nimport { useActionState } from 'react';\n\nimport { action } from './actions.js';\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(action, null);\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <form action={formAction}>\n\n      {/* ... */}\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nuseActionState returns an array with the following items:\n\nThe current state of the form, which is initially set to the initial state you provided, and after the form is submitted is set to the return value of the action you provided.\nA new action that you pass to <form> as its action prop or call manually within startTransition.\nA pending state that you can utilise while your action is processing.\n\nWhen the form is submitted, the action function that you provided will be called. Its return value will become the new current state of the form.\n\nThe action that you provide will also receive a new first argument, namely the current state of the form. The first time the form is submitted, this will be the initial state you provided, while with subsequent submissions, it will be the return value from the last time the action was called. The rest of the arguments are the same as if useActionState had not been used.\n\nfunction action(currentState, formData) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return 'next state';\n\n}\nDisplay information after submitting a form\n1. Display form errors\n2. Display structured information after submitting a form\nExample 1 of 2: Display form errors \n\nTo display messages such as an error message or toast that’s returned by a Server Function, wrap the action in a call to useActionState.\n\nApp.js\nactions.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useActionState, useState } from \"react\";\nimport { addToCart } from \"./actions.js\";\n\nfunction AddToCartForm({itemID, itemTitle}) {\n  const [message, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(addToCart, null);\n  return (\n    <form action={formAction}>\n      <h2>{itemTitle}</h2>\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"itemID\" value={itemID} />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Add to Cart</button>\n      {isPending ? \"Loading...\" : message}\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <AddToCartForm itemID=\"1\" itemTitle=\"JavaScript: The Definitive Guide\" />\n      <AddToCartForm itemID=\"2\" itemTitle=\"JavaScript: The Good Parts\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nTroubleshooting \nMy action can no longer read the submitted form data \n\nWhen you wrap an action with useActionState, it gets an extra argument as its first argument. The submitted form data is therefore its second argument instead of its first as it would usually be. The new first argument that gets added is the current state of the form.\n\nfunction action(currentState, formData) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\nHooks\nNEXT\nuseCallback"

    "title": "useCallback – React",
    "url": "https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback",
    "html": "API REFERENCE\nHOOKS\nuseCallback\n\nuseCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.\n\nconst cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies)\nNote\n\nReact Compiler automatically memoizes values and functions, reducing the need for manual useCallback calls. You can use the compiler to handle memoization automatically.\n\nReference\nuseCallback(fn, dependencies)\nUsage\nSkipping re-rendering of components\nUpdating state from a memoized callback\nPreventing an Effect from firing too often\nOptimizing a custom Hook\nTroubleshooting\nEvery time my component renders, useCallback returns a different function\nI need to call useCallback for each list item in a loop, but it’s not allowed\nReference \nuseCallback(fn, dependencies) \n\nCall useCallback at the top level of your component to cache a function definition between re-renders:\n\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nfn: The function value that you want to cache. It can take any arguments and return any values. React will return (not call!) your function back to you during the initial render. On next renders, React will give you the same function again if the dependencies have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will give you the function that you have passed during the current render, and store it in case it can be reused later. React will not call your function. The function is returned to you so you can decide when and whether to call it.\n\ndependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the fn code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison algorithm.\n\nReturns \n\nOn the initial render, useCallback returns the fn function you have passed.\n\nDuring subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored fn function from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or return the fn function you have passed during this render.\n\nCaveats \nuseCallback is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.\nReact will not throw away the cached function unless there is a specific reason to do that. For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache—for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should match your expectations if you rely on useCallback as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a state variable or a ref may be more appropriate.\nUsage \nSkipping re-rendering of components \n\nWhen you optimize rendering performance, you will sometimes need to cache the functions that you pass to child components. Let’s first look at the syntax for how to do this, and then see in which cases it’s useful.\n\nTo cache a function between re-renders of your component, wrap its definition into the useCallback Hook:\n\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n  // ...\n\nYou need to pass two things to useCallback:\n\nA function definition that you want to cache between re-renders.\nA list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your function.\n\nOn the initial render, the returned function you’ll get from useCallback will be the function you passed.\n\nOn the following renders, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the previous render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with Object.is), useCallback will return the same function as before. Otherwise, useCallback will return the function you passed on this render.\n\nIn other words, useCallback caches a function between re-renders until its dependencies change.\n\nLet’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.\n\nSay you’re passing a handleSubmit function down from the ProductPage to the ShippingForm component:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\nYou’ve noticed that toggling the theme prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove <ShippingForm /> from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the ShippingForm component.\n\nBy default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively. This is why, when ProductPage re-renders with a different theme, the ShippingForm component also re-renders. This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. But if you verified a re-render is slow, you can tell ShippingForm to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in memo:\n\nimport { memo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst ShippingForm = memo(function ShippingForm({ onSubmit }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nWith this change, ShippingForm will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the same as on the last render. This is when caching a function becomes important! Let’s say you defined handleSubmit without useCallback:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  // Every time the theme changes, this will be a different function...\n\n  function handleSubmit(orderDetails) {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      {/* ... so ShippingForm's props will never be the same, and it will re-render every time */}\n\n      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn JavaScript, a function () {} or () => {} always creates a different function, similar to how the {} object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it means that ShippingForm props will never be the same, and your memo optimization won’t work. This is where useCallback comes in handy:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  // Tell React to cache your function between re-renders...\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]); // ...so as long as these dependencies don't change...\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      {/* ...ShippingForm will receive the same props and can skip re-rendering */}\n\n      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nBy wrapping handleSubmit in useCallback, you ensure that it’s the same function between the re-renders (until dependencies change). You don’t have to wrap a function in useCallback unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in memo, and this lets it skip re-rendering. There are other reasons you might need useCallback which are described further on this page.\n\nNote\n\nYou should only rely on useCallback as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add useCallback back.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow is useCallback related to useMemo? \nShow Details\nDEEP DIVE\nShould you add useCallback everywhere? \nShow Details\nThe difference between useCallback and declaring a function directly\n1. Skipping re-rendering with useCallback and memo\n2. Always re-rendering a component\nExample 1 of 2: Skipping re-rendering with useCallback and memo \n\nIn this example, the ShippingForm component is artificially slowed down so that you can see what happens when a React component you’re rendering is genuinely slow. Try incrementing the counter and toggling the theme.\n\nIncrementing the counter feels slow because it forces the slowed down ShippingForm to re-render. That’s expected because the counter has changed, and so you need to reflect the user’s new choice on the screen.\n\nNext, try toggling the theme. Thanks to useCallback together with memo, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! ShippingForm skipped re-rendering because the handleSubmit function has not changed. The handleSubmit function has not changed because both productId and referrer (your useCallback dependencies) haven’t changed since last render.\n\nApp.js\nProductPage.js\nShippingForm.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport ShippingForm from './ShippingForm.js';\n\nexport default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n      referrer,\n      orderDetails,\n    });\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n  return (\n    <div className={theme}>\n      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction post(url, data) {\n  // Imagine this sends a request...\n  console.log('POST /' + url);\n  console.log(data);\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nUpdating state from a memoized callback \n\nSometimes, you might need to update state based on previous state from a memoized callback.\n\nThis handleAddTodo function specifies todos as a dependency because it computes the next todos from it:\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n\n\n  const handleAddTodo = useCallback((text) => {\n\n    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text };\n\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n\n  }, [todos]);\n\n  // ...\n\nYou’ll usually want memoized functions to have as few dependencies as possible. When you read some state only to calculate the next state, you can remove that dependency by passing an updater function instead:\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n\n\n  const handleAddTodo = useCallback((text) => {\n\n    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text };\n\n    setTodos(todos => [...todos, newTodo]);\n\n  }, []); // ✅ No need for the todos dependency\n\n  // ...\n\nHere, instead of making todos a dependency and reading it inside, you pass an instruction about how to update the state (todos => [...todos, newTodo]) to React. Read more about updater functions.\n\nPreventing an Effect from firing too often \n\nSometimes, you might want to call a function from inside an Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  function createOptions() {\n\n    return {\n\n      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    // ...\n\nThis creates a problem. Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency of your Effect. However, if you declare createOptions as a dependency, it will cause your Effect to constantly reconnect to the chat room:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [createOptions]); // 🔴 Problem: This dependency changes on every render\n\n  // ...\n\nTo solve this, you can wrap the function you need to call from an Effect into useCallback:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  const createOptions = useCallback(() => {\n\n    return {\n\n      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [createOptions]); // ✅ Only changes when createOptions changes\n\n  // ...\n\nThis ensures that the createOptions function is the same between re-renders if the roomId is the same. However, it’s even better to remove the need for a function dependency. Move your function inside the Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    function createOptions() { // ✅ No need for useCallback or function dependencies!\n\n      return {\n\n        serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n        roomId: roomId\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes\n\n  // ...\n\nNow your code is simpler and doesn’t need useCallback. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.\n\nOptimizing a custom Hook \n\nIf you’re writing a custom Hook, it’s recommended to wrap any functions that it returns into useCallback:\n\nfunction useRouter() {\n\n  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);\n\n\n\n  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {\n\n    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });\n\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n\n\n  const goBack = useCallback(() => {\n\n    dispatch({ type: 'back' });\n\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n\n\n  return {\n\n    navigate,\n\n    goBack,\n\n  };\n\n}\n\nThis ensures that the consumers of your Hook can optimize their own code when needed.\n\nTroubleshooting \nEvery time my component renders, useCallback returns a different function \n\nMake sure you’ve specified the dependency array as a second argument!\n\nIf you forget the dependency array, useCallback will return a new function every time:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }); // 🔴 Returns a new function every time: no dependency array\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is the corrected version passing the dependency array as a second argument:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]); // ✅ Does not return a new function unnecessarily\n\n  // ...\n\nIf this doesn’t help, then the problem is that at least one of your dependencies is different from the previous render. You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    // ..\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n\n\n  console.log([productId, referrer]);\n\nYou can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:\n\nObject.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...\n\nWhen you find which dependency is breaking memoization, either find a way to remove it, or memoize it as well.\n\nI need to call useCallback for each list item in a loop, but it’s not allowed \n\nSuppose the Chart component is wrapped in memo. You want to skip re-rendering every Chart in the list when the ReportList component re-renders. However, you can’t call useCallback in a loop:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <article>\n\n      {items.map(item => {\n\n        // 🔴 You can't call useCallback in a loop like this:\n\n        const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n\n          sendReport(item)\n\n        }, [item]);\n\n\n\n        return (\n\n          <figure key={item.id}>\n\n            <Chart onClick={handleClick} />\n\n          </figure>\n\n        );\n\n      })}\n\n    </article>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nInstead, extract a component for an individual item, and put useCallback there:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <article>\n\n      {items.map(item =>\n\n        <Report key={item.id} item={item} />\n\n      )}\n\n    </article>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Report({ item }) {\n\n  // ✅ Call useCallback at the top level:\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n\n    sendReport(item)\n\n  }, [item]);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <figure>\n\n      <Chart onClick={handleClick} />\n\n    </figure>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, you could remove useCallback in the last snippet and instead wrap Report itself in memo. If the item prop does not change, Report will skip re-rendering, so Chart will skip re-rendering too:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst Report = memo(function Report({ item }) {\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    sendReport(item);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <figure>\n\n      <Chart onClick={handleClick} />\n\n    </figure>\n\n  );\n\n});\nPREVIOUS\nuseActionState\nNEXT\nuseContext"

The context itself does not hold the information, it only represents the kind of information you can provide or read from components.\nReturns \n\nuseContext returns the context value for the calling component. It is determined as the value passed to the closest SomeContext above the calling component in the tree. If there is no such provider, then the returned value will be the defaultValue you have passed to createContext for that context. The returned value is always up-to-date. React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes.\n\nCaveats \nuseContext() call in a component is not affected by providers returned from the same component. The corresponding <Context> needs to be above the component doing the useContext() call.\nReact automatically re-renders all the children that use a particular context starting from the provider that receives a different value. The previous and the next values are compared with the Object.is comparison. Skipping re-renders with memo does not prevent the children receiving fresh context values.\nIf your build system produces duplicates modules in the output (which can happen with symlinks), this can break context. Passing something via context only works if SomeContext that you use to provide context and SomeContext that you use to read it are exactly the same object, as determined by a === comparison.\nUsage \nPassing data deeply into the tree \n\nCall useContext at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to context.\n\nimport { useContext } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  // ...\n\nuseContext returns the context value for the context you passed. To determine the context value, React searches the component tree and finds the closest context provider above for that particular context.\n\nTo pass context to a Button, wrap it or one of its parent components into the corresponding context provider:\n\nfunction MyPage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n\n      <Form />\n\n    </ThemeContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  // ... renders buttons inside ...\n\n}\n\nIt doesn’t matter how many layers of components there are between the provider and the Button. When a Button anywhere inside of Form calls useContext(ThemeContext), it will receive \"dark\" as the value.\n\nPitfall\n\nuseContext() always looks for the closest provider above the component that calls it. It searches upwards and does not consider providers in the component from which you’re calling useContext().\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, useContext } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n      <Form />\n    </ThemeContext>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <section className={className}>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Button({ children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'button-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <button className={className}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nUpdating data passed via context \n\nOften, you’ll want the context to change over time. To update context, combine it with state. Declare a state variable in the parent component, and pass the current state down as the context value to the provider.\n\nfunction MyPage() {\n\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark');\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n\n      <Form />\n\n      <Button onClick={() => {\n\n        setTheme('light');\n\n      }}>\n\n        Switch to light theme\n\n      </Button>\n\n    </ThemeContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNow any Button inside of the provider will receive the current theme value. If you call setTheme to update the theme value that you pass to the provider, all Button components will re-render with the new 'light' value.\n\nExamples of updating context\n1. Updating a value via context\n2. Updating an object via context\n3. Multiple contexts\n4. Extracting providers to a component\n5. Scaling up with context and a reducer\nExample 1 of 5: Updating a value via context \n\nIn this example, the MyApp component holds a state variable which is then passed to the ThemeContext provider. Checking the “Dark mode” checkbox updates the state. Changing the provided value re-renders all the components using that context.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n      <Form />\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          checked={theme === 'dark'}\n          onChange={(e) => {\n            setTheme(e.target.checked ? 'dark' : 'light')\n          }}\n        />\n        Use dark mode\n      </label>\n    </ThemeContext>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Form({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <section className={className}>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Button({ children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'button-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <button className={className}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNote that value=\"dark\" passes the \"dark\" string, but value={theme} passes the value of the JavaScript theme variable with JSX curly braces. Curly braces also let you pass context values that aren’t strings.\n\nNext Example\nSpecifying a fallback default value \n\nIf React can’t find any providers of that particular context in the parent tree, the context value returned by useContext() will be equal to the default value that you specified when you created that context:\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nThe default value never changes. If you want to update context, use it with state as described above.\n\nOften, instead of null, there is some more meaningful value you can use as a default, for example:\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nThis way, if you accidentally render some component without a corresponding provider, it won’t break. This also helps your components work well in a test environment without setting up a lot of providers in the tests.\n\nIn the example below, the “Toggle theme” button is always light because it’s outside any theme context provider and the default context theme value is 'light'. Try editing the default theme to be 'dark'.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n        <Form />\n      </ThemeContext>\n      <Button onClick={() => {\n        setTheme(theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark');\n      }}>\n        Toggle theme\n      </Button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Form({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <section className={className}>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Button({ children, onClick }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'button-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <button className={className} onClick={onClick}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nOverriding context for a part of the tree \n\nYou can override the context for a part of the tree by wrapping that part in a provider with a different value.\n\n<ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n\n  ...\n\n  <ThemeContext value=\"light\">\n\n    <Footer />\n\n  </ThemeContext>\n\n  ...\n\n</ThemeContext>\n\nYou can nest and override providers as many times as you need.\n\nExamples of overriding context\n1. Overriding a theme\n2. Automatically nested headings\nExample 1 of 2: Overriding a theme \n\nHere, the button inside the Footer receives a different context value (\"light\") than the buttons outside (\"dark\").\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, useContext } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n      <Form />\n    </ThemeContext>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n      <ThemeContext value=\"light\">\n        <Footer />\n      </ThemeContext>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Footer() {\n  return (\n    <footer>\n      <Button>Settings</Button>\n    </footer>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <section className={className}>\n      {title && <h1>{title}</h1>}\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Button({ children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'button-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <button className={className}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nOptimizing re-renders when passing objects and functions \n\nYou can pass any values via context, including objects and functions.\n\nfunction MyApp() {\n\n  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  function login(response) {\n\n    storeCredentials(response.credentials);\n\n    setCurrentUser(response.user);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <AuthContext value={{ currentUser, login }}>\n\n      <Page />\n\n    </AuthContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nHere, the context value is a JavaScript object with two properties, one of which is a function. Whenever MyApp re-renders (for example, on a route update), this will be a different object pointing at a different function, so React will also have to re-render all components deep in the tree that call useContext(AuthContext).\n\nIn smaller apps, this is not a problem. However, there is no need to re-render them if the underlying data, like currentUser, has not changed. To help React take advantage of that fact, you may wrap the login function with useCallback and wrap the object creation into useMemo. This is a performance optimization:\n\nimport { useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction MyApp() {\n\n  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  const login = useCallback((response) => {\n\n    storeCredentials(response.credentials);\n\n    setCurrentUser(response.user);\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({\n\n    currentUser,\n\n    login\n\n  }), [currentUser, login]);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <AuthContext value={contextValue}>\n\n      <Page />\n\n    </AuthContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAs a result of this change, even if MyApp needs to re-render, the components calling useContext(AuthContext) won’t need to re-render unless currentUser has changed.\n\nRead more about useMemo and useCallback.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy component doesn’t see the value from my provider \n\nThere are a few common ways that this can happen:\n\nYou’re rendering <SomeContext> in the same component (or below) as where you’re calling useContext(). Move <SomeContext> above and outside the component calling useContext().\nYou may have forgotten to wrap your component with <SomeContext>, or you might have put it in a different part of the tree than you thought. Check whether the hierarchy is right using React DevTools.\nYou might be running into some build issue with your tooling that causes SomeContext as seen from the providing component and SomeContext as seen by the reading component to be two different objects. This can happen if you use symlinks, for example. You can verify this by assigning them to globals like window.SomeContext1 and window.SomeContext2 and then checking whether window.SomeContext1 === window.SomeContext2 in the console. If they’re not the same, fix that issue on the build tool level.\nI am always getting undefined from my context although the default value is different \n\nYou might have a provider without a value in the tree:\n\n// 🚩 Doesn't work: no value prop\n\n<ThemeContext>\n\n   <Button />\n\n</ThemeContext>\n\nIf you forget to specify value, it’s like passing value={undefined}.\n\nYou may have also mistakingly used a different prop name by mistake:\n\n// 🚩 Doesn't work: prop should be called \"value\"\n\n<ThemeContext theme={theme}>\n\n   <Button />\n\n</ThemeContext>\n\nIn both of these cases you should see a warning from React in the console. To fix them, call the prop value:\n\n// ✅ Passing the value prop\n\n<ThemeContext value={theme}>\n\n   <Button />\n\n</ThemeContext>\n\nNote that the default value from your createContext(defaultValue) call is only used if there is no matching provider above at all. If there is a <SomeContext value={undefined}> component somewhere in the parent tree, the component calling useContext(SomeContext) will receive undefined as the context value.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseCallback\nNEXT\nuseDebugValue"

It can have any type.\noptional initialValue: A value to use during the initial render of a component. If this option is omitted, useDeferredValue will not defer during the initial render, because there’s no previous version of value that it can render instead.\nReturns \ncurrentValue: During the initial render, the returned deferred value will be the initialValue, or the same as the value you provided. During updates, React will first attempt a re-render with the old value (so it will return the old value), and then try another re-render in the background with the new value (so it will return the updated value).\nCaveats \n\nWhen an update is inside a Transition, useDeferredValue always returns the new value and does not spawn a deferred render, since the update is already deferred.\n\nThe values you pass to useDeferredValue should either be primitive values (like strings and numbers) or objects created outside of rendering. If you create a new object during rendering and immediately pass it to useDeferredValue, it will be different on every render, causing unnecessary background re-renders.\n\nWhen useDeferredValue receives a different value (compared with Object.is), in addition to the current render (when it still uses the previous value), it schedules a re-render in the background with the new value. The background re-render is interruptible: if there’s another update to the value, React will restart the background re-render from scratch. For example, if the user is typing into an input faster than a chart receiving its deferred value can re-render, the chart will only re-render after the user stops typing.\n\nuseDeferredValue is integrated with <Suspense>. If the background update caused by a new value suspends the UI, the user will not see the fallback. They will see the old deferred value until the data loads.\n\nuseDeferredValue does not by itself prevent extra network requests.\n\nThere is no fixed delay caused by useDeferredValue itself. As soon as React finishes the original re-render, React will immediately start working on the background re-render with the new deferred value. Any updates caused by events (like typing) will interrupt the background re-render and get prioritized over it.\n\nThe background re-render caused by useDeferredValue does not fire Effects until it’s committed to the screen. If the background re-render suspends, its Effects will run after the data loads and the UI updates.\n\nUsage \nShowing stale content while fresh content is loading \n\nCall useDeferredValue at the top level of your component to defer updating some part of your UI.\n\nimport { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction SearchPage() {\n\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nDuring the initial render, the deferred value will be the same as the value you provided.\n\nDuring updates, the deferred value will “lag behind” the latest value. In particular, React will first re-render without updating the deferred value, and then try to re-render with the newly received value in the background.\n\nLet’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.\n\nNote\n\nThis example assumes you use a Suspense-enabled data source:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a Promise with use\n\nLearn more about Suspense and its limitations.\n\nIn this example, the SearchResults component suspends while fetching the search results. Try typing \"a\", waiting for the results, and then editing it to \"ab\". The results for \"a\" get replaced by the loading fallback.\n\nApp.js\nSearchResults.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <SearchResults query={query} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nA common alternative UI pattern is to defer updating the list of results and to keep showing the previous results until the new results are ready. Call useDeferredValue to pass a deferred version of the query down:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <label>\n\n        Search albums:\n\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n\n      </label>\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n\n        <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe query will update immediately, so the input will display the new value. However, the deferredQuery will keep its previous value until the data has loaded, so SearchResults will show the stale results for a bit.\n\nEnter \"a\" in the example below, wait for the results to load, and then edit the input to \"ab\". Notice how instead of the Suspense fallback, you now see the stale result list until the new results have loaded:\n\nApp.js\nSearchResults.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDEEP DIVE\nHow does deferring a value work under the hood? \nShow Details\nIndicating that the content is stale \n\nIn the example above, there is no indication that the result list for the latest query is still loading. This can be confusing to the user if the new results take a while to load. To make it more obvious to the user that the result list does not match the latest query, you can add a visual indication when the stale result list is displayed:\n\n<div style={{\n\n  opacity: query !== deferredQuery ? 0.5 : 1,\n\n}}>\n\n  <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n\n</div>\n\nWith this change, as soon as you start typing, the stale result list gets slightly dimmed until the new result list loads. You can also add a CSS transition to delay dimming so that it feels gradual, like in the example below:\n\nApp.js\nSearchResults.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n  const isStale = query !== deferredQuery;\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <div style={{\n          opacity: isStale ? 0.5 : 1,\n          transition: isStale ? 'opacity 0.2s 0.2s linear' : 'opacity 0s 0s linear'\n        }}>\n          <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n        </div>\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDeferring re-rendering for a part of the UI \n\nYou can also apply useDeferredValue as a performance optimization. It is useful when a part of your UI is slow to re-render, there’s no easy way to optimize it, and you want to prevent it from blocking the rest of the UI.\n\nImagine you have a text field and a component (like a chart or a long list) that re-renders on every keystroke:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />\n\n      <SlowList text={text} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nFirst, optimize SlowList to skip re-rendering when its props are the same. To do this, wrap it in memo:\n\nconst SlowList = memo(function SlowList({ text }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nHowever, this only helps if the SlowList props are the same as during the previous render. The problem you’re facing now is that it’s slow when they’re different, and when you actually need to show different visual output.\n\nConcretely, the main performance problem is that whenever you type into the input, the SlowList receives new props, and re-rendering its entire tree makes the typing feel janky. In this case, useDeferredValue lets you prioritize updating the input (which must be fast) over updating the result list (which is allowed to be slower):\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text);\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />\n\n      <SlowList text={deferredText} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis does not make re-rendering of the SlowList faster. However, it tells React that re-rendering the list can be deprioritized so that it doesn’t block the keystrokes. The list will “lag behind” the input and then “catch up”. Like before, React will attempt to update the list as soon as possible, but will not block the user from typing.\n\nThe difference between useDeferredValue and unoptimized re-rendering\n1. Deferred re-rendering of the list\n2. Unoptimized re-rendering of the list\nExample 1 of 2: Deferred re-rendering of the list \n\nIn this example, each item in the SlowList component is artificially slowed down so that you can see how useDeferredValue lets you keep the input responsive. Type into the input and notice that typing feels snappy while the list “lags behind” it.\n\nApp.js\nSlowList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\nimport SlowList from './SlowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n  const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />\n      <SlowList text={deferredText} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nNext Example\nPitfall\n\nThis optimization requires SlowList to be wrapped in memo. This is because whenever the text changes, React needs to be able to re-render the parent component quickly. During that re-render, deferredText still has its previous value, so SlowList is able to skip re-rendering (its props have not changed). Without memo, it would have to re-render anyway, defeating the point of the optimization.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow is deferring a value different from debouncing and throttling? \nShow Details\nPREVIOUS\nuseDebugValue\nNEXT\nuseEffect"

Your setup function may also optionally return a cleanup function. When your component is added to the DOM, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. After your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.\n\noptional dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the setup code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. If you omit this argument, your Effect will re-run after every re-render of the component. See the difference between passing an array of dependencies, an empty array, and no dependencies at all.\n\nReturns \n\nuseEffect returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \n\nuseEffect is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.\n\nIf you’re not trying to synchronize with some external system, you probably don’t need an Effect.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function.\n\nIf some of your dependencies are objects or functions defined inside the component, there is a risk that they will cause the Effect to re-run more often than needed. To fix this, remove unnecessary object and function dependencies. You can also extract state updates and non-reactive logic outside of your Effect.\n\nIf your Effect wasn’t caused by an interaction (like a click), React will generally let the browser paint the updated screen first before running your Effect. If your Effect is doing something visual (for example, positioning a tooltip), and the delay is noticeable (for example, it flickers), replace useEffect with useLayoutEffect.\n\nIf your Effect is caused by an interaction (like a click), React may run your Effect before the browser paints the updated screen. This ensures that the result of the Effect can be observed by the event system. Usually, this works as expected. However, if you must defer the work until after paint, such as an alert(), you can use setTimeout. See reactwg/react-18/128 for more information.\n\nEven if your Effect was caused by an interaction (like a click), React may allow the browser to repaint the screen before processing the state updates inside your Effect. Usually, this works as expected. However, if you must block the browser from repainting the screen, you need to replace useEffect with useLayoutEffect.\n\nEffects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.\n\nUsage \nConnecting to an external system \n\nSome components need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, while they are displayed on the page. These systems aren’t controlled by React, so they are called external.\n\nTo connect your component to some external system, call useEffect at the top level of your component:\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n  \tconst connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n  \treturn () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n  \t};\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nYou need to pass two arguments to useEffect:\n\nA setup function with setup code that connects to that system.\nIt should return a cleanup function with cleanup code that disconnects from that system.\nA list of dependencies including every value from your component used inside of those functions.\n\nReact calls your setup and cleanup functions whenever it’s necessary, which may happen multiple times:\n\nYour setup code runs when your component is added to the page (mounts).\nAfter every re-render of your component where the dependencies have changed:\nFirst, your cleanup code runs with the old props and state.\nThen, your setup code runs with the new props and state.\nYour cleanup code runs one final time after your component is removed from the page (unmounts).\n\nLet’s illustrate this sequence for the example above.\n\nWhen the ChatRoom component above gets added to the page, it will connect to the chat room with the initial serverUrl and roomId. If either serverUrl or roomId change as a result of a re-render (say, if the user picks a different chat room in a dropdown), your Effect will disconnect from the previous room, and connect to the next one. When the ChatRoom component is removed from the page, your Effect will disconnect one last time.\n\nTo help you find bugs, in development React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the setup. This is a stress-test that verifies your Effect’s logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as in development). See common solutions.\n\nTry to write every Effect as an independent process and think about a single setup/cleanup cycle at a time. It shouldn’t matter whether your component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. When your cleanup logic correctly “mirrors” the setup logic, your Effect is resilient to running setup and cleanup as often as needed.\n\nNote\n\nAn Effect lets you keep your component synchronized with some external system (like a chat service). Here, external system means any piece of code that’s not controlled by React, such as:\n\nA timer managed with setInterval() and clearInterval().\nAn event subscription using window.addEventListener() and window.removeEventListener().\nA third-party animation library with an API like animation.start() and animation.reset().\n\nIf you’re not connecting to any external system, you probably don’t need an Effect.\n\nExamples of connecting to an external system\n1. Connecting to a chat server\n2. Listening to a global browser event\n3. Triggering an animation\n4. Controlling a modal dialog\n5. Tracking element visibility\nExample 1 of 5: Connecting to a chat server \n\nIn this example, the ChatRoom component uses an Effect to stay connected to an external system defined in chat.js. Press “Open chat” to make the ChatRoom component appear. This sandbox runs in development mode, so there is an extra connect-and-disconnect cycle, as explained here. Try changing the roomId and serverUrl using the dropdown and the input, and see how the Effect re-connects to the chat. Press “Close chat” to see the Effect disconnect one last time.\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => {\n      connection.disconnect();\n    };\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}\n      </button>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nWrapping Effects in custom Hooks \n\nEffects are an “escape hatch”: you use them when you need to “step outside React” and when there is no better built-in solution for your use case. If you find yourself often needing to manually write Effects, it’s usually a sign that you need to extract some custom Hooks for common behaviors your components rely on.\n\nFor example, this useChatRoom custom Hook “hides” the logic of your Effect behind a more declarative API:\n\nfunction useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = {\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n\n}\n\nThen you can use it from any component like this:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n\n\n  useChatRoom({\n\n    roomId: roomId,\n\n    serverUrl: serverUrl\n\n  });\n\n  // ...\n\nThere are also many excellent custom Hooks for every purpose available in the React ecosystem.\n\nLearn more about wrapping Effects in custom Hooks.\n\nExamples of wrapping Effects in custom Hooks\n1. Custom useChatRoom Hook\n2. Custom useWindowListener Hook\n3. Custom useIntersectionObserver Hook\nExample 1 of 3: Custom useChatRoom Hook \n\nThis example is identical to one of the earlier examples, but the logic is extracted to a custom Hook.\n\nApp.js\nuseChatRoom.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useChatRoom } from './useChatRoom.js';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useChatRoom({\n    roomId: roomId,\n    serverUrl: serverUrl\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}\n      </button>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nControlling a non-React widget \n\nSometimes, you want to keep an external system synchronized to some prop or state of your component.\n\nFor example, if you have a third-party map widget or a video player component written without React, you can use an Effect to call methods on it that make its state match the current state of your React component. This Effect creates an instance of a MapWidget class defined in map-widget.js. When you change the zoomLevel prop of the Map component, the Effect calls the setZoom() on the class instance to keep it synchronized:\n\nApp.js\nMap.js\nmap-widget.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { MapWidget } from './map-widget.js';\n\nexport default function Map({ zoomLevel }) {\n  const containerRef = useRef(null);\n  const mapRef = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (mapRef.current === null) {\n      mapRef.current = new MapWidget(containerRef.current);\n    }\n\n    const map = mapRef.current;\n    map.setZoom(zoomLevel);\n  }, [zoomLevel]);\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}\n      ref={containerRef}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn this example, a cleanup function is not needed because the MapWidget class manages only the DOM node that was passed to it. After the Map React component is removed from the tree, both the DOM node and the MapWidget class instance will be automatically garbage-collected by the browser JavaScript engine.\n\nFetching data with Effects \n\nYou can use an Effect to fetch data for your component. Note that if you use a framework, using your framework’s data fetching mechanism will be a lot more efficient than writing Effects manually.\n\nIf you want to fetch data from an Effect manually, your code might look like this:\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nimport { fetchBio } from './api.js';\n\n\n\nexport default function Page() {\n\n  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');\n\n  const [bio, setBio] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    let ignore = false;\n\n    setBio(null);\n\n    fetchBio(person).then(result => {\n\n      if (!ignore) {\n\n        setBio(result);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    return () => {\n\n      ignore = true;\n\n    };\n\n  }, [person]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\nNote the ignore variable which is initialized to false, and is set to true during cleanup. This ensures your code doesn’t suffer from “race conditions”: network responses may arrive in a different order than you sent them.\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { fetchBio } from './api.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');\n  const [bio, setBio] = useState(null);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    let ignore = false;\n    setBio(null);\n    fetchBio(person).then(result => {\n      if (!ignore) {\n        setBio(result);\n      }\n    });\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    }\n  }, [person]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <select value={person} onChange={e => {\n        setPerson(e.target.value);\n      }}>\n        <option value=\"Alice\">Alice</option>\n        <option value=\"Bob\">Bob</option>\n        <option value=\"Taylor\">Taylor</option>\n      </select>\n      <hr />\n      <p><i>{bio ?? 'Loading...'}</i></p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou can also rewrite using the async / await syntax, but you still need to provide a cleanup function:\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { fetchBio } from './api.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');\n  const [bio, setBio] = useState(null);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    async function startFetching() {\n      setBio(null);\n      const result = await fetchBio(person);\n      if (!ignore) {\n        setBio(result);\n      }\n    }\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    startFetching();\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    }\n  }, [person]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <select value={person} onChange={e => {\n        setPerson(e.target.value);\n      }}>\n        <option value=\"Alice\">Alice</option>\n        <option value=\"Bob\">Bob</option>\n        <option value=\"Taylor\">Taylor</option>\n      </select>\n      <hr />\n      <p><i>{bio ?? 'Loading...'}</i></p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWriting data fetching directly in Effects gets repetitive and makes it difficult to add optimizations like caching and server rendering later. It’s easier to use a custom Hook—either your own or maintained by the community.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhat are good alternatives to data fetching in Effects? \nShow Details\nSpecifying reactive dependencies \n\nNotice that you can’t “choose” the dependencies of your Effect. Every reactive value used by your Effect’s code must be declared as a dependency. Your Effect’s dependency list is determined by the surrounding code:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // This is a reactive value\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // This is a reactive value too\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads these reactive values\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]); // ✅ So you must specify them as dependencies of your Effect\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIf either serverUrl or roomId change, your Effect will reconnect to the chat using the new values.\n\nReactive values include props and all variables and functions declared directly inside of your component. Since roomId and serverUrl are reactive values, you can’t remove them from the dependencies. If you try to omit them and your linter is correctly configured for React, the linter will flag this as a mistake you need to fix:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  \n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'roomId' and 'serverUrl'\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nTo remove a dependency, you need to “prove” to the linter that it doesn’t need to be a dependency. For example, you can move serverUrl out of your component to prove that it’s not reactive and won’t change on re-renders:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // Not a reactive value anymore\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNow that serverUrl is not a reactive value (and can’t change on a re-render), it doesn’t need to be a dependency. If your Effect’s code doesn’t use any reactive values, its dependency list should be empty ([]):\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // Not a reactive value anymore\n\nconst roomId = 'music'; // Not a reactive value anymore\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom() {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nAn Effect with empty dependencies doesn’t re-run when any of your component’s props or state change.\n\nPitfall\n\nIf you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // ...\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter like this:\n\n  // eslint-ignore-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\n\n}, []);\n\nWhen dependencies don’t match the code, there is a high risk of introducing bugs. By suppressing the linter, you “lie” to React about the values your Effect depends on. Instead, prove they’re unnecessary.\n\nExamples of passing reactive dependencies\n1. Passing a dependency array\n2. Passing an empty dependency array\n3. Passing no dependency array at all\nExample 1 of 3: Passing a dependency array \n\nIf you specify the dependencies, your Effect runs after the initial render and after re-renders with changed dependencies.\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // ...\n\n}, [a, b]); // Runs again if a or b are different\n\nIn the below example, serverUrl and roomId are reactive values, so they both must be specified as dependencies. As a result, selecting a different room in the dropdown or editing the server URL input causes the chat to re-connect. However, since message isn’t used in the Effect (and so it isn’t a dependency), editing the message doesn’t re-connect to the chat.\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => {\n      connection.disconnect();\n    };\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n      <label>\n        Your message:{' '}\n        <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n        <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n          {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}\n        </button>\n      </label>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId}/>}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nUpdating state based on previous state from an Effect \n\nWhen you want to update state based on previous state from an Effect, you might run into a problem:\n\nfunction Counter() {\n\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {\n\n      setCount(count + 1); // You want to increment the counter every second...\n\n    }, 1000)\n\n    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);\n\n  }, [count]); // 🚩 ... but specifying `count` as a dependency always resets the interval.\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSince count is a reactive value, it must be specified in the list of dependencies. However, that causes the Effect to cleanup and setup again every time the count changes. This is not ideal.\n\nTo fix this, pass the c => c + 1 state updater to setCount:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {\n      setCount(c => c + 1); // ✅ Pass a state updater\n    }, 1000);\n    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);\n  }, []); // ✅ Now count is not a dependency\n\n  return <h1>{count}</h1>;\n}\n\n\n\nNow that you’re passing c => c + 1 instead of count + 1, your Effect no longer needs to depend on count. As a result of this fix, it won’t need to cleanup and setup the interval again every time the count changes.\n\nRemoving unnecessary object dependencies \n\nIf your Effect depends on an object or a function created during rendering, it might run too often. For example, this Effect re-connects after every render because the options object is different for every render:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  const options = { // 🚩 This object is created from scratch on every re-render\n\n    serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n    roomId: roomId\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options); // It's used inside the Effect\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [options]); // 🚩 As a result, these dependencies are always different on a re-render\n\n  // ...\n\nAvoid using an object created during rendering as a dependency. Instead, create the object inside the Effect:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const options = {\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n      roomId: roomId\n    };\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNow that you create the options object inside the Effect, the Effect itself only depends on the roomId string.\n\nWith this fix, typing into the input doesn’t reconnect the chat. Unlike an object which gets re-created, a string like roomId doesn’t change unless you set it to another value. Read more about removing dependencies.\n\nRemoving unnecessary function dependencies \n\nIf your Effect depends on an object or a function created during rendering, it might run too often. For example, this Effect re-connects after every render because the createOptions function is different for every render:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  function createOptions() { // 🚩 This function is created from scratch on every re-render\n\n    return {\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = createOptions(); // It's used inside the Effect\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [createOptions]); // 🚩 As a result, these dependencies are always different on a re-render\n\n  // ...\n\nBy itself, creating a function from scratch on every re-render is not a problem. You don’t need to optimize that. However, if you use it as a dependency of your Effect, it will cause your Effect to re-run after every re-render.\n\nAvoid using a function created during rendering as a dependency. Instead, declare it inside the Effect:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    function createOptions() {\n      return {\n        serverUrl: serverUrl,\n        roomId: roomId\n      };\n    }\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNow that you define the createOptions function inside the Effect, the Effect itself only depends on the roomId string. With this fix, typing into the input doesn’t reconnect the chat. Unlike a function which gets re-created, a string like roomId doesn’t change unless you set it to another value. Read more about removing dependencies.\n\nReading the latest props and state from an Effect \n\nBy default, when you read a reactive value from an Effect, you have to add it as a dependency. This ensures that your Effect “reacts” to every change of that value. For most dependencies, that’s the behavior you want.\n\nHowever, sometimes you’ll want to read the latest props and state from an Effect without “reacting” to them. For example, imagine you want to log the number of the items in the shopping cart for every page visit:\n\nfunction Page({ url, shoppingCart }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    logVisit(url, shoppingCart.length);\n\n  }, [url, shoppingCart]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nWhat if you want to log a new page visit after every url change, but not if only the shoppingCart changes? You can’t exclude shoppingCart from dependencies without breaking the reactivity rules. However, you can express that you don’t want a piece of code to “react” to changes even though it is called from inside an Effect. Declare an Effect Event with the useEffectEvent Hook, and move the code reading shoppingCart inside of it:\n\nfunction Page({ url, shoppingCart }) {\n\n  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {\n\n    logVisit(visitedUrl, shoppingCart.length)\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    onVisit(url);\n\n  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nEffect Events are not reactive and must always be omitted from dependencies of your Effect. This is what lets you put non-reactive code (where you can read the latest value of some props and state) inside of them. By reading shoppingCart inside of onVisit, you ensure that shoppingCart won’t re-run your Effect.\n\nRead more about how Effect Events let you separate reactive and non-reactive code.\n\nDisplaying different content on the server and the client \n\nIf your app uses server rendering (either directly or via a framework), your component will render in two different environments. On the server, it will render to produce the initial HTML. On the client, React will run the rendering code again so that it can attach your event handlers to that HTML. This is why, for hydration to work, your initial render output must be identical on the client and the server.\n\nIn rare cases, you might need to display different content on the client. For example, if your app reads some data from localStorage, it can’t possibly do that on the server. Here is how you could implement this:\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const [didMount, setDidMount] = useState(false);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    setDidMount(true);\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  if (didMount) {\n\n    // ... return client-only JSX ...\n\n  }  else {\n\n    // ... return initial JSX ...\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nWhile the app is loading, the user will see the initial render output. Then, when it’s loaded and hydrated, your Effect will run and set didMount to true, triggering a re-render. This will switch to the client-only render output. Effects don’t run on the server, so this is why didMount was false during the initial server render.\n\nUse this pattern sparingly. Keep in mind that users with a slow connection will see the initial content for quite a bit of time—potentially, many seconds—so you don’t want to make jarring changes to your component’s appearance. In many cases, you can avoid the need for this by conditionally showing different things with CSS.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy Effect runs twice when the component mounts \n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, in development, React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the actual setup.\n\nThis is a stress-test that verifies your Effect’s logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as in development).\n\nRead more about how this helps find bugs and how to fix your logic.\n\nMy Effect runs after every re-render \n\nFirst, check that you haven’t forgotten to specify the dependency array:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // ...\n\n}); // 🚩 No dependency array: re-runs after every render!\n\nIf you’ve specified the dependency array but your Effect still re-runs in a loop, it’s because one of your dependencies is different on every re-render.\n\nYou can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    // ..\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\n\n\n  console.log([serverUrl, roomId]);\n\nYou can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:\n\nObject.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...\n\nWhen you find the dependency that is different on every re-render, you can usually fix it in one of these ways:\n\nUpdating state based on previous state from an Effect\nRemoving unnecessary object dependencies\nRemoving unnecessary function dependencies\nReading the latest props and state from an Effect\n\nAs a last resort (if these methods didn’t help), wrap its creation with useMemo or useCallback (for functions).\n\nMy Effect keeps re-running in an infinite cycle \n\nIf your Effect runs in an infinite cycle, these two things must be true:\n\nYour Effect is updating some state.\nThat state leads to a re-render, which causes the Effect’s dependencies to change.\n\nBefore you start fixing the problem, ask yourself whether your Effect is connecting to some external system (like DOM, network, a third-party widget, and so on). Why does your Effect need to set state? Does it synchronize with that external system? Or are you trying to manage your application’s data flow with it?\n\nIf there is no external system, consider whether removing the Effect altogether would simplify your logic.\n\nIf you’re genuinely synchronizing with some external system, think about why and under what conditions your Effect should update the state. Has something changed that affects your component’s visual output? If you need to keep track of some data that isn’t used by rendering, a ref (which doesn’t trigger re-renders) might be more appropriate. Verify your Effect doesn’t update the state (and trigger re-renders) more than needed.\n\nFinally, if your Effect is updating the state at the right time, but there is still a loop, it’s because that state update leads to one of the Effect’s dependencies changing. Read how to debug dependency changes.\n\nMy cleanup logic runs even though my component didn’t unmount \n\nThe cleanup function runs not only during unmount, but before every re-render with changed dependencies. Additionally, in development, React runs setup+cleanup one extra time immediately after component mounts.\n\nIf you have cleanup code without corresponding setup code, it’s usually a code smell:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: Cleanup logic without corresponding setup logic\n\n  return () => {\n\n    doSomething();\n\n  };\n\n}, []);\n\nYour cleanup logic should be “symmetrical” to the setup logic, and should stop or undo whatever setup did:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\nLearn how the Effect lifecycle is different from the component’s lifecycle.\n\nMy Effect does something visual, and I see a flicker before it runs \n\nIf your Effect must block the browser from painting the screen, replace useEffect with useLayoutEffect. Note that this shouldn’t be needed for the vast majority of Effects. You’ll only need this if it’s crucial to run your Effect before the browser paint: for example, to measure and position a tooltip before the user sees it.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseDeferredValue\nNEXT\nuseEffectEvent"

Effect Events are functions you can call inside Effects, such as useEffect:\n\nimport { useEffectEvent, useEffect } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {\n\n  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {\n\n    showNotification('Connected!', theme);\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.on('connected', () => {\n\n      onConnected();\n\n    });\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \ncallback: A function containing the logic for your Effect Event. When you define an Effect Event with useEffectEvent, the callback always accesses the latest values from props and state when it is invoked. This helps avoid issues with stale closures.\nReturns \n\nReturns an Effect Event function. You can call this function inside useEffect, useLayoutEffect, or useInsertionEffect.\n\nCaveats \nOnly call inside Effects: Effect Events should only be called within Effects. Define them just before the Effect that uses them. Do not pass them to other components or hooks. The eslint-plugin-react-hooks linter (version 6.1.1 or higher) will enforce this restriction to prevent calling Effect Events in the wrong context.\nNot a dependency shortcut: Do not use useEffectEvent to avoid specifying dependencies in your Effect’s dependency array. This can hide bugs and make your code harder to understand. Prefer explicit dependencies or use refs to compare previous values if needed.\nUse for non-reactive logic: Only use useEffectEvent to extract logic that does not depend on changing values.\nUsage \nReading the latest props and state \n\nTypically, when you access a reactive value inside an Effect, you must include it in the dependency array. This makes sure your Effect runs again whenever that value changes, which is usually the desired behavior.\n\nBut in some cases, you may want to read the most recent props or state inside an Effect without causing the Effect to re-run when those values change.\n\nTo read the latest props or state in your Effect, without making those values reactive, include them in an Effect Event.\n\nimport { useEffect, useContext, useEffectEvent } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Page({ url }) {\n\n  const { items } = useContext(ShoppingCartContext);\n\n  const numberOfItems = items.length;\n\n\n\n  const onNavigate = useEffectEvent((visitedUrl) => {\n\n    logVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    onNavigate(url);\n\n  }, [url]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIn this example, the Effect should re-run after a render when url changes (to log the new page visit), but it should not re-run when numberOfItems changes. By wrapping the logging logic in an Effect Event, numberOfItems becomes non-reactive. It’s always read from the latest value without triggering the Effect.\n\nYou can pass reactive values like url as arguments to the Effect Event to keep them reactive while accessing the latest non-reactive values inside the event.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseEffect\nNEXT\nuseId"

For example, you can specify that an element (like an input) is described by another element (like a paragraph).\n\nIn regular HTML, you would write it like this:\n\n<label>\n\n  Password:\n\n  <input\n\n    type=\"password\"\n\n    aria-describedby=\"password-hint\"\n\n  />\n\n</label>\n\n<p id=\"password-hint\">\n\n  The password should contain at least 18 characters\n\n</p>\n\nHowever, hardcoding IDs like this is not a good practice in React.

That ref handle can have any type. Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.\n\noptional dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the createHandle code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. If a re-render resulted in a change to some dependency, or if you omitted this argument, your createHandle function will re-execute, and the newly created handle will be assigned to the ref.\n\nNote\n\nStarting with React 19, ref is available as a prop. In React 18 and earlier, it was necessary to get the ref from forwardRef.\n\nReturns \n\nuseImperativeHandle returns undefined.\n\nUsage \nExposing a custom ref handle to the parent component \n\nTo expose a DOM node to the parent element, pass in the ref prop to the node.\n\nfunction MyInput({ ref }) {\n\n  return <input ref={ref} />;\n\n};\n\nWith the code above, a ref to MyInput will receive the <input> DOM node. However, you can expose a custom value instead. To customize the exposed handle, call useImperativeHandle at the top level of your component:\n\nimport { useImperativeHandle } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction MyInput({ ref }) {\n\n  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {\n\n    return {\n\n      // ... your methods ...\n\n    };\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return <input />;\n\n};\n\nNote that in the code above, the ref is no longer passed to the <input>.\n\nFor example, suppose you don’t want to expose the entire <input> DOM node, but you want to expose two of its methods: focus and scrollIntoView. To do this, keep the real browser DOM in a separate ref. Then use useImperativeHandle to expose a handle with only the methods that you want the parent component to call:\n\nimport { useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction MyInput({ ref }) {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {\n\n    return {\n\n      focus() {\n\n        inputRef.current.focus();\n\n      },\n\n      scrollIntoView() {\n\n        inputRef.current.scrollIntoView();\n\n      },\n\n    };\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return <input ref={inputRef} />;\n\n};\n\nNow, if the parent component gets a ref to MyInput, it will be able to call the focus and scrollIntoView methods on it. However, it will not have full access to the underlying <input> DOM node.\n\nApp.js\nMyInput.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport MyInput from './MyInput.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current.focus();\n    // This won't work because the DOM node isn't exposed:\n    // ref.current.style.opacity = 0.5;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <MyInput placeholder=\"Enter your name\" ref={ref} />\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n        Edit\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nExposing your own imperative methods \n\nThe methods you expose via an imperative handle don’t have to match the DOM methods exactly. For example, this Post component exposes a scrollAndFocusAddComment method via an imperative handle. This lets the parent Page scroll the list of comments and focus the input field when you click the button:\n\nApp.js\nPost.js\nCommentList.js\nAddComment.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport Post from './Post.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const postRef = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    postRef.current.scrollAndFocusAddComment();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Write a comment\n      </button>\n      <Post ref={postRef} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nDo not overuse refs. You should only use refs for imperative behaviors that you can’t express as props: for example, scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, and so on.\n\nIf you can express something as a prop, you should not use a ref. For example, instead of exposing an imperative handle like { open, close } from a Modal component, it is better to take isOpen as a prop like <Modal isOpen={isOpen} />. Effects can help you expose imperative behaviors via props.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseId\nNEXT\nuseInsertionEffect"

Your setup function may also optionally return a cleanup function. When your component is added to the DOM, but before any layout Effects fire, React will run your setup function.

You shouldn’t rely on the DOM being updated at any particular time.\nUnlike other types of Effects, which fire cleanup for every Effect and then setup for every Effect, useInsertionEffect will fire both cleanup and setup one component at a time. This results in an “interleaving” of the cleanup and setup functions.\nUsage \nInjecting dynamic styles from CSS-in-JS libraries \n\nTraditionally, you would style React components using plain CSS.\n\n// In your JS file:\n\n<button className=\"success\" />\n\n\n\n// In your CSS file:\n\n.success { color: green; }\n\nSome teams prefer to author styles directly in JavaScript code instead of writing CSS files. This usually requires using a CSS-in-JS library or a tool. There are three common approaches to CSS-in-JS:\n\nStatic extraction to CSS files with a compiler\nInline styles, e.g. <div style={{ opacity: 1 }}>\nRuntime injection of <style> tags\n\nIf you use CSS-in-JS, we recommend a combination of the first two approaches (CSS files for static styles, inline styles for dynamic styles). We don’t recommend runtime <style> tag injection for two reasons:\n\nRuntime injection forces the browser to recalculate the styles a lot more often.\nRuntime injection can be very slow if it happens at the wrong time in the React lifecycle.\n\nThe first problem is not solvable, but useInsertionEffect helps you solve the second problem.\n\nCall useInsertionEffect to insert the styles before any layout Effects fire:\n\n// Inside your CSS-in-JS library\n\nlet isInserted = new Set();\n\nfunction useCSS(rule) {\n\n  useInsertionEffect(() => {\n\n    // As explained earlier, we don't recommend runtime injection of <style> tags.\n\n    // But if you have to do it, then it's important to do in useInsertionEffect.\n\n    if (!isInserted.has(rule)) {\n\n      isInserted.add(rule);\n\n      document.head.appendChild(getStyleForRule(rule));\n\n    }\n\n  });\n\n  return rule;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const className = useCSS('...');\n\n  return <div className={className} />;\n\n}\n\nSimilarly to useEffect, useInsertionEffect does not run on the server. If you need to collect which CSS rules have been used on the server, you can do it during rendering:\n\nlet collectedRulesSet = new Set();\n\n\n\nfunction useCSS(rule) {\n\n  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {\n\n    collectedRulesSet.add(rule);\n\n  }\n\n  useInsertionEffect(() => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  });\n\n  return rule;\n\n}\n\nRead more about upgrading CSS-in-JS libraries with runtime injection to useInsertionEffect.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow is this better than injecting styles during rendering or useLayoutEffect? \nShow Details\nPREVIOUS\nuseImperativeHandle\nNEXT\nuseLayoutEffect"

You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a component and move the Effect there.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function.\n\nIf some of your dependencies are objects or functions defined inside the component, there is a risk that they will cause the Effect to re-run more often than needed. To fix this, remove unnecessary object and function dependencies. You can also extract state updates and non-reactive logic outside of your Effect.\n\nEffects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.\n\nThe code inside useLayoutEffect and all state updates scheduled from it block the browser from repainting the screen. When used excessively, this makes your app slow. When possible, prefer useEffect.\n\nIf you trigger a state update inside useLayoutEffect, React will execute all remaining Effects immediately including useEffect.\n\nUsage \nMeasuring layout before the browser repaints the screen \n\nMost components don’t need to know their position and size on the screen to decide what to render. They only return some JSX. Then the browser calculates their layout (position and size) and repaints the screen.\n\nSometimes, that’s not enough. Imagine a tooltip that appears next to some element on hover. If there’s enough space, the tooltip should appear above the element, but if it doesn’t fit, it should appear below. In order to render the tooltip at the right final position, you need to know its height (i.e. whether it fits at the top).\n\nTo do this, you need to render in two passes:\n\nRender the tooltip anywhere (even with a wrong position).\nMeasure its height and decide where to place the tooltip.\nRender the tooltip again in the correct place.\n\nAll of this needs to happen before the browser repaints the screen. You don’t want the user to see the tooltip moving. Call useLayoutEffect to perform the layout measurements before the browser repaints the screen:\n\nfunction Tooltip() {\n\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  const [tooltipHeight, setTooltipHeight] = useState(0); // You don't know real height yet\n\n\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n\n    const { height } = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect();\n\n    setTooltipHeight(height); // Re-render now that you know the real height\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  // ...use tooltipHeight in the rendering logic below...\n\n}\n\nHere’s how this works step by step:\n\nTooltip renders with the initial tooltipHeight = 0 (so the tooltip may be wrongly positioned).\nReact places it in the DOM and runs the code in useLayoutEffect.\nYour useLayoutEffect measures the height of the tooltip content and triggers an immediate re-render.\nTooltip renders again with the real tooltipHeight (so the tooltip is correctly positioned).\nReact updates it in the DOM, and the browser finally displays the tooltip.\n\nHover over the buttons below and see how the tooltip adjusts its position depending on whether it fits:\n\nApp.js\nButtonWithTooltip.js\nTooltip.js\nTooltipContainer.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef, useLayoutEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\nimport TooltipContainer from './TooltipContainer.js';\n\nexport default function Tooltip({ children, targetRect }) {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n  const [tooltipHeight, setTooltipHeight] = useState(0);\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n    const { height } = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect();\n    setTooltipHeight(height);\n    console.log('Measured tooltip height: ' + height);\n  }, []);\n\n  let tooltipX = 0;\n  let tooltipY = 0;\n  if (targetRect !== null) {\n    tooltipX = targetRect.left;\n    tooltipY = targetRect.top - tooltipHeight;\n    if (tooltipY < 0) {\n      // It doesn't fit above, so place below.\n      tooltipY = targetRect.bottom;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return createPortal(\n    <TooltipContainer x={tooltipX} y={tooltipY} contentRef={ref}>\n      {children}\n    </TooltipContainer>,\n    document.body\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice that even though the Tooltip component has to render in two passes (first, with tooltipHeight initialized to 0 and then with the real measured height), you only see the final result. This is why you need useLayoutEffect instead of useEffect for this example. Let’s look at the difference in detail below.\n\nuseLayoutEffect vs useEffect\n1. useLayoutEffect blocks the browser from repainting\n2. useEffect does not block the browser\nExample 1 of 2: useLayoutEffect blocks the browser from repainting \n\nReact guarantees that the code inside useLayoutEffect and any state updates scheduled inside it will be processed before the browser repaints the screen. This lets you render the tooltip, measure it, and re-render the tooltip again without the user noticing the first extra render. In other words, useLayoutEffect blocks the browser from painting.\n\nApp.js\nButtonWithTooltip.js\nTooltip.js\nTooltipContainer.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef, useLayoutEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\nimport TooltipContainer from './TooltipContainer.js';\n\nexport default function Tooltip({ children, targetRect }) {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n  const [tooltipHeight, setTooltipHeight] = useState(0);\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n    const { height } = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect();\n    setTooltipHeight(height);\n  }, []);\n\n  let tooltipX = 0;\n  let tooltipY = 0;\n  if (targetRect !== null) {\n    tooltipX = targetRect.left;\n    tooltipY = targetRect.top - tooltipHeight;\n    if (tooltipY < 0) {\n      // It doesn't fit above, so place below.\n      tooltipY = targetRect.bottom;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return createPortal(\n    <TooltipContainer x={tooltipX} y={tooltipY} contentRef={ref}>\n      {children}\n    </TooltipContainer>,\n    document.body\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nNote\n\nRendering in two passes and blocking the browser hurts performance. Try to avoid this when you can.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI’m getting an error: “useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server” \n\nThe purpose of useLayoutEffect is to let your component use layout information for rendering:\n\nRender the initial content.\nMeasure the layout before the browser repaints the screen.\nRender the final content using the layout information you’ve read.\n\nWhen you or your framework uses server rendering, your React app renders to HTML on the server for the initial render. This lets you show the initial HTML before the JavaScript code loads.\n\nThe problem is that on the server, there is no layout information.\n\nIn the earlier example, the useLayoutEffect call in the Tooltip component lets it position itself correctly (either above or below content) depending on the content height. If you tried to render Tooltip as a part of the initial server HTML, this would be impossible to determine. On the server, there is no layout yet! So, even if you rendered it on the server, its position would “jump” on the client after the JavaScript loads and runs.\n\nUsually, components that rely on layout information don’t need to render on the server anyway. For example, it probably doesn’t make sense to show a Tooltip during the initial render. It is triggered by a client interaction.\n\nHowever, if you’re running into this problem, you have a few different options:\n\nReplace useLayoutEffect with useEffect. This tells React that it’s okay to display the initial render result without blocking the paint (because the original HTML will become visible before your Effect runs).\n\nAlternatively, mark your component as client-only. This tells React to replace its content up to the closest <Suspense> boundary with a loading fallback (for example, a spinner or a glimmer) during server rendering.\n\nAlternatively, you can render a component with useLayoutEffect only after hydration. Keep a boolean isMounted state that’s initialized to false, and set it to true inside a useEffect call. Your rendering logic can then be like return isMounted ? <RealContent /> : <FallbackContent />. On the server and during the hydration, the user will see FallbackContent which should not call useLayoutEffect. Then React will replace it with RealContent which runs on the client only and can include useLayoutEffect calls.\n\nIf you synchronize your component with an external data store and rely on useLayoutEffect for different reasons than measuring layout, consider useSyncExternalStore instead which supports server rendering.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseInsertionEffect\nNEXT\nuseMemo"

For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache—for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should be fine if you rely on useMemo solely as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a state variable or a ref may be more appropriate.\nNote\n\nCaching return values like this is also known as memoization, which is why this Hook is called useMemo.\n\nUsage \nSkipping expensive recalculations \n\nTo cache a calculation between re-renders, wrap it in a useMemo call at the top level of your component:\n\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nYou need to pass two things to useMemo:\n\nA calculation function that takes no arguments, like () =>, and returns what you wanted to calculate.\nA list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your calculation.\n\nOn the initial render, the value you’ll get from useMemo will be the result of calling your calculation.\n\nOn every subsequent render, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the last render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with Object.is), useMemo will return the value you already calculated before. Otherwise, React will re-run your calculation and return the new value.\n\nIn other words, useMemo caches a calculation result between re-renders until its dependencies change.\n\nLet’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.\n\nBy default, React will re-run the entire body of your component every time that it re-renders. For example, if this TodoList updates its state or receives new props from its parent, the filterTodos function will re-run:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nUsually, this isn’t a problem because most calculations are very fast. However, if you’re filtering or transforming a large array, or doing some expensive computation, you might want to skip doing it again if data hasn’t changed. If both todos and tab are the same as they were during the last render, wrapping the calculation in useMemo like earlier lets you reuse visibleTodos you’ve already calculated before.\n\nThis type of caching is called memoization.\n\nNote\n\nYou should only rely on useMemo as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add useMemo to improve performance.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow to tell if a calculation is expensive? \nShow Details\nDEEP DIVE\nShould you add useMemo everywhere? \nShow Details\nThe difference between useMemo and calculating a value directly\n1. Skipping recalculation with useMemo\n2. Always recalculating a value\nExample 1 of 2: Skipping recalculation with useMemo \n\nIn this example, the filterTodos implementation is artificially slowed down so that you can see what happens when some JavaScript function you’re calling during rendering is genuinely slow. Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme.\n\nSwitching the tabs feels slow because it forces the slowed down filterTodos to re-execute. That’s expected because the tab has changed, and so the entire calculation needs to re-run. (If you’re curious why it runs twice, it’s explained here.)\n\nToggle the theme. Thanks to useMemo, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! The slow filterTodos call was skipped because both todos and tab (which you pass as dependencies to useMemo) haven’t changed since the last render.\n\nApp.js\nTodoList.js\nutils.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';\nimport { filterTodos } from './utils.js'\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, theme, tab }) {\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(\n    () => filterTodos(todos, tab),\n    [todos, tab]\n  );\n  return (\n    <div className={theme}>\n      <p><b>Note: <code>filterTodos</code> is artificially slowed down!</b></p>\n      <ul>\n        {visibleTodos.map(todo => (\n          <li key={todo.id}>\n            {todo.completed ?\n              <s>{todo.text}</s> :\n              todo.text\n            }\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nSkipping re-rendering of components \n\nIn some cases, useMemo can also help you optimize performance of re-rendering child components. To illustrate this, let’s say this TodoList component passes the visibleTodos as a prop to the child List component:\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      <List items={visibleTodos} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nYou’ve noticed that toggling the theme prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove <List /> from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the List component.\n\nBy default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively. This is why, when TodoList re-renders with a different theme, the List component also re-renders. This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. But if you’ve verified that a re-render is slow, you can tell List to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in memo:\n\nimport { memo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst List = memo(function List({ items }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nWith this change, List will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the same as on the last render. This is where caching the calculation becomes important! Imagine that you calculated visibleTodos without useMemo:\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  // Every time the theme changes, this will be a different array...\n\n  const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      {/* ... so List's props will never be the same, and it will re-render every time */}\n\n      <List items={visibleTodos} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn the above example, the filterTodos function always creates a different array, similar to how the {} object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it means that List props will never be the same, and your memo optimization won’t work. This is where useMemo comes in handy:\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  // Tell React to cache your calculation between re-renders...\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(\n\n    () => filterTodos(todos, tab),\n\n    [todos, tab] // ...so as long as these dependencies don't change...\n\n  );\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      {/* ...List will receive the same props and can skip re-rendering */}\n\n      <List items={visibleTodos} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nBy wrapping the visibleTodos calculation in useMemo, you ensure that it has the same value between the re-renders (until dependencies change). You don’t have to wrap a calculation in useMemo unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in memo, and this lets it skip re-rendering. There are a few other reasons to add useMemo which are described further on this page.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nMemoizing individual JSX nodes \nShow Details\nThe difference between skipping re-renders and always re-rendering\n1.

Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme.\n\nSwitching the tabs feels slow because it forces the slowed down List to re-render. That’s expected because the tab has changed, and so you need to reflect the user’s new choice on the screen.\n\nNext, try toggling the theme. Thanks to useMemo together with memo, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! The List skipped re-rendering because the visibleTodos array has not changed since the last render. The visibleTodos array has not changed because both todos and tab (which you pass as dependencies to useMemo) haven’t changed since the last render.\n\nApp.js\nTodoList.js\nList.js\nutils.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';\nimport List from './List.js';\nimport { filterTodos } from './utils.js'\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, theme, tab }) {\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(\n    () => filterTodos(todos, tab),\n    [todos, tab]\n  );\n  return (\n    <div className={theme}>\n      <p><b>Note: <code>List</code> is artificially slowed down!</b></p>\n      <List items={visibleTodos} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nPreventing an Effect from firing too often \n\nSometimes, you might want to use a value inside an Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  const options = {\n\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n    roomId: roomId\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    // ...\n\nThis creates a problem. Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency of your Effect. However, if you declare options as a dependency, it will cause your Effect to constantly reconnect to the chat room:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [options]); // 🔴 Problem: This dependency changes on every render\n\n  // ...\n\nTo solve this, you can wrap the object you need to call from an Effect in useMemo:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  const options = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return {\n\n      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [options]); // ✅ Only changes when options changes\n\n  // ...\n\nThis ensures that the options object is the same between re-renders if useMemo returns the cached object.\n\nHowever, since useMemo is performance optimization, not a semantic guarantee, React may throw away the cached value if there is a specific reason to do that. This will also cause the effect to re-fire, so it’s even better to remove the need for a function dependency by moving your object inside the Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = { // ✅ No need for useMemo or object dependencies!\n\n      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes\n\n  // ...\n\nNow your code is simpler and doesn’t need useMemo. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.\n\nMemoizing a dependency of another Hook \n\nSuppose you have a calculation that depends on an object created directly in the component body:\n\nfunction Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {\n\n  const searchOptions = { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };\n\n\n\n  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);\n\n  }, [allItems, searchOptions]); // 🚩 Caution: Dependency on an object created in the component body\n\n  // ...\n\nDepending on an object like this defeats the point of memoization. When a component re-renders, all of the code directly inside the component body runs again. The lines of code creating the searchOptions object will also run on every re-render. Since searchOptions is a dependency of your useMemo call, and it’s different every time, React knows the dependencies are different, and recalculate searchItems every time.\n\nTo fix this, you could memoize the searchOptions object itself before passing it as a dependency:\n\nfunction Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {\n\n  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };\n\n  }, [text]); // ✅ Only changes when text changes\n\n\n\n  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);\n\n  }, [allItems, searchOptions]); // ✅ Only changes when allItems or searchOptions changes\n\n  // ...\n\nIn the example above, if the text did not change, the searchOptions object also won’t change. However, an even better fix is to move the searchOptions object declaration inside of the useMemo calculation function:\n\nfunction Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {\n\n  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {\n\n    const searchOptions = { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };\n\n    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);\n\n  }, [allItems, text]); // ✅ Only changes when allItems or text changes\n\n  // ...\n\nNow your calculation depends on text directly (which is a string and can’t “accidentally” become different).\n\nMemoizing a function \n\nSuppose the Form component is wrapped in memo. You want to pass a function to it as a prop:\n\nexport default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  function handleSubmit(orderDetails) {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;\n\n}\n\nJust as {} creates a different object, function declarations like function() {} and expressions like () => {} produce a different function on every re-render. By itself, creating a new function is not a problem. This is not something to avoid! However, if the Form component is memoized, presumably you want to skip re-rendering it when no props have changed. A prop that is always different would defeat the point of memoization.\n\nTo memoize a function with useMemo, your calculation function would have to return another function:\n\nexport default function Page({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return (orderDetails) => {\n\n      post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n        referrer,\n\n        orderDetails\n\n      });\n\n    };\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n\n\n  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;\n\n}\n\nThis looks clunky! Memoizing functions is common enough that React has a built-in Hook specifically for that. Wrap your functions into useCallback instead of useMemo to avoid having to write an extra nested function:\n\nexport default function Page({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n\n\n  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;\n\n}\n\nThe two examples above are completely equivalent. The only benefit to useCallback is that it lets you avoid writing an extra nested function inside. It doesn’t do anything else. Read more about useCallback.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy calculation runs twice on every re-render \n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab }) {\n\n  // This component function will run twice for every render.\n\n\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {\n\n    // This calculation will run twice if any of the dependencies change.\n\n    return filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n  }, [todos, tab]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is expected and shouldn’t break your code.\n\nThis development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component and calculation functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice and fix the mistake.\n\nFor example, this impure calculation function mutates an array you received as a prop:\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {\n\n    // 🚩 Mistake: mutating a prop\n\n    todos.push({ id: 'last', text: 'Go for a walk!' });\n\n    const filtered = filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n    return filtered;\n\n  }, [todos, tab]);\n\nReact calls your function twice, so you’d notice the todo is added twice. Your calculation shouldn’t change any existing objects, but it’s okay to change any new objects you created during the calculation. For example, if the filterTodos function always returns a different array, you can mutate that array instead:\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {\n\n    const filtered = filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n    // ✅ Correct: mutating an object you created during the calculation\n\n    filtered.push({ id: 'last', text: 'Go for a walk!' });\n\n    return filtered;\n\n  }, [todos, tab]);\n\nRead keeping components pure to learn more about purity.\n\nAlso, check out the guides on updating objects and updating arrays without mutation.\n\nMy useMemo call is supposed to return an object, but returns undefined \n\nThis code doesn’t work:\n\n  // 🔴 You can't return an object from an arrow function with () => {\n\n  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {\n\n    matchMode: 'whole-word',\n\n    text: text\n\n  }, [text]);\n\nIn JavaScript, () => { starts the arrow function body, so the { brace is not a part of your object. This is why it doesn’t return an object, and leads to mistakes. You could fix it by adding parentheses like ({ and }):\n\n  // This works, but is easy for someone to break again\n\n  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => ({\n\n    matchMode: 'whole-word',\n\n    text: text\n\n  }), [text]);\n\nHowever, this is still confusing and too easy for someone to break by removing the parentheses.\n\nTo avoid this mistake, write a return statement explicitly:\n\n  // ✅ This works and is explicit\n\n  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return {\n\n      matchMode: 'whole-word',\n\n      text: text\n\n    };\n\n  }, [text]);\nEvery time my component renders, the calculation in useMemo re-runs \n\nMake sure you’ve specified the dependency array as a second argument!\n\nIf you forget the dependency array, useMemo will re-run the calculation every time:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab }) {\n\n  // 🔴 Recalculates every time: no dependency array\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab));\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is the corrected version passing the dependency array as a second argument:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab }) {\n\n  // ✅ Does not recalculate unnecessarily\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);\n\n  // ...\n\nIf this doesn’t help, then the problem is that at least one of your dependencies is different from the previous render. You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);\n\n  console.log([todos, tab]);\n\nYou can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:\n\nObject.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...\n\nWhen you find which dependency breaks memoization, either find a way to remove it, or memoize it as well.\n\nI need to call useMemo for each list item in a loop, but it’s not allowed \n\nSuppose the Chart component is wrapped in memo. You want to skip re-rendering every Chart in the list when the ReportList component re-renders. However, you can’t call useMemo in a loop:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <article>\n\n      {items.map(item => {\n\n        // 🔴 You can't call useMemo in a loop like this:\n\n        const data = useMemo(() => calculateReport(item), [item]);\n\n        return (\n\n          <figure key={item.id}>\n\n            <Chart data={data} />\n\n          </figure>\n\n        );\n\n      })}\n\n    </article>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nInstead, extract a component for each item and memoize data for individual items:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <article>\n\n      {items.map(item =>\n\n        <Report key={item.id} item={item} />\n\n      )}\n\n    </article>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Report({ item }) {\n\n  // ✅ Call useMemo at the top level:\n\n  const data = useMemo(() => calculateReport(item), [item]);\n\n  return (\n\n    <figure>\n\n      <Chart data={data} />\n\n    </figure>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, you could remove useMemo and instead wrap Report itself in memo. If the item prop does not change, Report will skip re-rendering, so Chart will skip re-rendering too:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst Report = memo(function Report({ item }) {\n\n  const data = calculateReport(item);\n\n  return (\n\n    <figure>\n\n      <Chart data={data} />\n\n    </figure>\n\n  );\n\n});\nPREVIOUS\nuseLayoutEffect\nNEXT\nuseOptimistic"

It accepts some state as an argument and returns a copy of that state that can be different during the duration of an async action such as a network request. You provide a function that takes the current state and the input to the action, and returns the optimistic state to be used while the action is pending.\n\nThis state is called the “optimistic” state because it is usually used to immediately present the user with the result of performing an action, even though the action actually takes time to complete.\n\nimport { useOptimistic } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction AppContainer() {\n\n  const [optimisticState, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic(\n\n    state,\n\n    // updateFn\n\n    (currentState, optimisticValue) => {\n\n      // merge and return new state\n\n      // with optimistic value\n\n    }\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \nstate: the value to be returned initially and whenever no action is pending.\nupdateFn(currentState, optimisticValue): a function that takes the current state and the optimistic value passed to addOptimistic and returns the resulting optimistic state. It must be a pure function. updateFn takes in two parameters. The currentState and the optimisticValue. The return value will be the merged value of the currentState and optimisticValue.\nReturns \noptimisticState: The resulting optimistic state. It is equal to state unless an action is pending, in which case it is equal to the value returned by updateFn.\naddOptimistic: addOptimistic is the dispatching function to call when you have an optimistic update. It takes one argument, optimisticValue, of any type and will call the updateFn with state and optimisticValue.\nUsage \nOptimistically updating forms \n\nThe useOptimistic Hook provides a way to optimistically update the user interface before a background operation, like a network request, completes. In the context of forms, this technique helps to make apps feel more responsive. When a user submits a form, instead of waiting for the server’s response to reflect the changes, the interface is immediately updated with the expected outcome.\n\nFor example, when a user types a message into the form and hits the “Send” button, the useOptimistic Hook allows the message to immediately appear in the list with a “Sending…” label, even before the message is actually sent to a server. This “optimistic” approach gives the impression of speed and responsiveness. The form then attempts to truly send the message in the background. Once the server confirms the message has been received, the “Sending…” label is removed.\n\nApp.js\nactions.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useOptimistic, useState, useRef, startTransition } from \"react\";\nimport { deliverMessage } from \"./actions.js\";\n\nfunction Thread({ messages, sendMessageAction }) {\n  const formRef = useRef();\n  function formAction(formData) {\n    addOptimisticMessage(formData.get(\"message\"));\n    formRef.current.reset();\n    startTransition(async () => {\n      await sendMessageAction(formData);\n    });\n  }\n  const [optimisticMessages, addOptimisticMessage] = useOptimistic(\n    messages,\n    (state, newMessage) => [\n      {\n        text: newMessage,\n        sending: true\n      },\n      ...state,\n    ]\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <form action={formAction} ref={formRef}>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"message\" placeholder=\"Hello!\" />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n      {optimisticMessages.map((message, index) => (\n        <div key={index}>\n          {message.text}\n          {!!message.sending && <small> (Sending...)</small>}\n        </div>\n      ))}\n      \n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([\n    { text: \"Hello there!\", sending: false, key: 1 }\n  ]);\n  async function sendMessageAction(formData) {\n    const sentMessage = await deliverMessage(formData.get(\"message\"));\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setMessages((messages) => [{ text: sentMessage }, ...messages]);\n    })\n  }\n  return <Thread messages={messages} sendMessageAction={sendMessageAction} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPREVIOUS\nuseMemo\nNEXT\nuseReducer"

It must be pure, should take the state and action as arguments, and should return the next state. State and action can be of any types.\ninitialArg: The value from which the initial state is calculated. It can be a value of any type. How the initial state is calculated from it depends on the next init argument.\noptional init: The initializer function that should return the initial state. If it’s not specified, the initial state is set to initialArg. Otherwise, the initial state is set to the result of calling init(initialArg).\nReturns \n\nuseReducer returns an array with exactly two values:\n\nThe current state. During the first render, it’s set to init(initialArg) or initialArg (if there’s no init).\nThe dispatch function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.\nCaveats \nuseReducer is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.\nThe dispatch function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your reducer and initializer twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your reducer and initializer are pure (as they should be), this should not affect your logic. The result from one of the calls is ignored.\ndispatch function \n\nThe dispatch function returned by useReducer lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You need to pass the action as the only argument to the dispatch function:\n\nconst [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });\n\n\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });\n\n  // ...\n\nReact will set the next state to the result of calling the reducer function you’ve provided with the current state and the action you’ve passed to dispatch.\n\nParameters \naction: The action performed by the user. It can be a value of any type. By convention, an action is usually an object with a type property identifying it and, optionally, other properties with additional information.\nReturns \n\ndispatch functions do not have a return value.\n\nCaveats \n\nThe dispatch function only updates the state variable for the next render. If you read the state variable after calling the dispatch function, you will still get the old value that was on the screen before your call.\n\nIf the new value you provide is identical to the current state, as determined by an Object.is comparison, React will skip re-rendering the component and its children. This is an optimization. React may still need to call your component before ignoring the result, but it shouldn’t affect your code.\n\nReact batches state updates. It updates the screen after all the event handlers have run and have called their set functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use flushSync.\n\nUsage \nAdding a reducer to a component \n\nCall useReducer at the top level of your component to manage state with a reducer.\n\nimport { useReducer } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });\n\n  // ...\n\nuseReducer returns an array with exactly two items:\n\nThe current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.\nThe dispatch function that lets you change it in response to interaction.\n\nTo update what’s on the screen, call dispatch with an object representing what the user did, called an action:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });\n\n}\n\nReact will pass the current state and the action to your reducer function. Your reducer will calculate and return the next state. React will store that next state, render your component with it, and update the UI.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useReducer } from 'react';\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n  if (action.type === 'incremented_age') {\n    return {\n      age: state.age + 1\n    };\n  }\n  throw Error('Unknown action.');\n}\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' })\n      }}>\n        Increment age\n      </button>\n      <p>Hello! You are {state.age}.</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nuseReducer is very similar to useState, but it lets you move the state update logic from event handlers into a single function outside of your component. Read more about choosing between useState and useReducer.\n\nWriting the reducer function \n\nA reducer function is declared like this:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThen you need to fill in the code that will calculate and return the next state. By convention, it is common to write it as a switch statement. For each case in the switch, calculate and return some next state.\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      return {\n\n        name: state.name,\n\n        age: state.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    case 'changed_name': {\n\n      return {\n\n        name: action.nextName,\n\n        age: state.age\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);\n\n}\n\nActions can have any shape. By convention, it’s common to pass objects with a type property identifying the action. It should include the minimal necessary information that the reducer needs to compute the next state.\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { name: 'Taylor', age: 42 });\n\n  \n\n  function handleButtonClick() {\n\n    dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  function handleInputChange(e) {\n\n    dispatch({\n\n      type: 'changed_name',\n\n      nextName: e.target.value\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nThe action type names are local to your component. Each action describes a single interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in data. The shape of the state is arbitrary, but usually it’ll be an object or an array.\n\nRead extracting state logic into a reducer to learn more.\n\nPitfall\n\nState is read-only. Don’t modify any objects or arrays in state:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      // 🚩 Don't mutate an object in state like this:\n\n      state.age = state.age + 1;\n\n      return state;\n\n    }\n\nInstead, always return new objects from your reducer:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      // ✅ Instead, return a new object\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state,\n\n        age: state.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\nRead updating objects in state and updating arrays in state to learn more.\n\nBasic useReducer examples\n1.

You are {state.age}.</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nAvoiding recreating the initial state \n\nReact saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.\n\nfunction createInitialState(username) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction TodoList({ username }) {\n\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, createInitialState(username));\n\n  // ...\n\nAlthough the result of createInitialState(username) is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.\n\nTo solve this, you may pass it as an initializer function to useReducer as the third argument instead:\n\nfunction createInitialState(username) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction TodoList({ username }) {\n\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, username, createInitialState);\n\n  // ...\n\nNotice that you’re passing createInitialState, which is the function itself, and not createInitialState(), which is the result of calling it. This way, the initial state does not get re-created after initialization.\n\nIn the above example, createInitialState takes a username argument. If your initializer doesn’t need any information to compute the initial state, you may pass null as the second argument to useReducer.\n\nThe difference between passing an initializer and passing the initial state directly\n1. Passing the initializer function\n2. Passing the initial state directly\nExample 1 of 2: Passing the initializer function \n\nThis example passes the initializer function, so the createInitialState function only runs during initialization. It does not run when component re-renders, such as when you type into the input.\n\nTodoList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useReducer } from 'react';\n\nfunction createInitialState(username) {\n  const initialTodos = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {\n    initialTodos.push({\n      id: i,\n      text: username + \"'s task #\" + (i + 1)\n    });\n  }\n  return {\n    draft: '',\n    todos: initialTodos,\n  };\n}\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'changed_draft': {\n      return {\n        draft: action.nextDraft,\n        todos: state.todos,\n      };\n    };\n    case 'added_todo': {\n      return {\n        draft: '',\n        todos: [{\n          id: state.todos.length,\n          text: state.draft\n        }, ...state.todos]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);\n}\n\nexport default function TodoList({ username }) {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(\n    reducer,\n    username,\n    createInitialState\n  );\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input\n        value={state.draft}\n        onChange={e => {\n          dispatch({\n            type: 'changed_draft',\n            nextDraft: e.target.value\n          })\n        }}\n      />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        dispatch({ type: 'added_todo' });\n      }}>Add</button>\n      <ul>\n        {state.todos.map(item => (\n          <li key={item.id}>\n            {item.text}\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nTroubleshooting \nI’ve dispatched an action, but logging gives me the old state value \n\nCalling the dispatch function does not change state in the running code:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  console.log(state.age);  // 42\n\n\n\n  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' }); // Request a re-render with 43\n\n  console.log(state.age);  // Still 42!\n\n\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    console.log(state.age); // Also 42!\n\n  }, 5000);\n\n}\n\nThis is because states behaves like a snapshot. Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the state JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.\n\nIf you need to guess the next state value, you can calculate it manually by calling the reducer yourself:\n\nconst action = { type: 'incremented_age' };\n\ndispatch(action);\n\n\n\nconst nextState = reducer(state, action);\n\nconsole.log(state);     // { age: 42 }\n\nconsole.log(nextState); // { age: 43 }\nI’ve dispatched an action, but the screen doesn’t update \n\nReact will ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state, as determined by an Object.is comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object\n\n      state.age++;\n\n      return state;\n\n    }\n\n    case 'changed_name': {\n\n      // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object\n\n      state.name = action.nextName;\n\n      return state;\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nYou mutated an existing state object and returned it, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you’re always updating objects in state and updating arrays in state instead of mutating them:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      // ✅ Correct: creating a new object\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state,\n\n        age: state.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    case 'changed_name': {\n\n      // ✅ Correct: creating a new object\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state,\n\n        name: action.nextName\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n}\nA part of my reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching \n\nMake sure that every case branch copies all of the existing fields when returning the new state:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state, // Don't forget this!\n\n        age: state.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\nWithout ...state above, the returned next state would only contain the age field and nothing else.\n\nMy entire reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching \n\nIf your state unexpectedly becomes undefined, you’re likely forgetting to return state in one of the cases, or your action type doesn’t match any of the case statements. To find why, throw an error outside the switch:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      // ...\n\n    }\n\n    case 'edited_name': {\n\n      // ...\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);\n\n}\n\nYou can also use a static type checker like TypeScript to catch such mistakes.\n\nI’m getting an error: “Too many re-renders” \n\nYou might get an error that says: Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop. Typically, this means that you’re unconditionally dispatching an action during render, so your component enters a loop: render, dispatch (which causes a render), render, dispatch (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: calls the handler during render\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: passes down the event handler\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: passes down an inline function\n\nreturn <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>\n\nIf you can’t find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific dispatch function call responsible for the error.\n\nMy reducer or initializer function runs twice \n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your reducer and initializer functions twice. This shouldn’t break your code.\n\nThis development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and reducer functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.\n\nFor example, this impure reducer function mutates an array in state:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'added_todo': {\n\n      // 🚩 Mistake: mutating state\n\n      state.todos.push({ id: nextId++, text: action.text });\n\n      return state;\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nBecause React calls your reducer function twice, you’ll see the todo was added twice, so you’ll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by replacing the array instead of mutating it:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'added_todo': {\n\n      // ✅ Correct: replacing with new state\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state,\n\n        todos: [\n\n          ...state.todos,\n\n          { id: nextId++, text: action.text }\n\n        ]\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nNow that this reducer function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn’t make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. Only component, initializer, and reducer functions need to be pure. Event handlers don’t need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.\n\nRead keeping components pure to learn more.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseOptimistic\nNEXT\nuseRef"

It can be a value of any type. This argument is ignored after the initial render.\nReturns \n\nuseRef returns an object with a single property:\n\ncurrent: Initially, it’s set to the initialValue you have passed. You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a ref attribute to a JSX node, React will set its current property.\n\nOn the next renders, useRef will return the same object.\n\nCaveats \nYou can mutate the ref.current property. Unlike state, it is mutable. However, if it holds an object that is used for rendering (for example, a piece of your state), then you shouldn’t mutate that object.\nWhen you change the ref.current property, React does not re-render your component. React is not aware of when you change it because a ref is a plain JavaScript object.\nDo not write or read ref.current during rendering, except for initialization. This makes your component’s behavior unpredictable.\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your component function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. Each ref object will be created twice, but one of the versions will be discarded. If your component function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior.\nUsage \nReferencing a value with a ref \n\nCall useRef at the top level of your component to declare one or more refs.\n\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Stopwatch() {\n\n  const intervalRef = useRef(0);\n\n  // ...\n\nuseRef returns a ref object with a single current property initially set to the initial value you provided.\n\nOn the next renders, useRef will return the same object. You can change its current property to store information and read it later. This might remind you of state, but there is an important difference.\n\nChanging a ref does not trigger a re-render. This means refs are perfect for storing information that doesn’t affect the visual output of your component. For example, if you need to store an interval ID and retrieve it later, you can put it in a ref. To update the value inside the ref, you need to manually change its current property:\n\nfunction handleStartClick() {\n\n  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }, 1000);\n\n  intervalRef.current = intervalId;\n\n}\n\nLater, you can read that interval ID from the ref so that you can call clear that interval:\n\nfunction handleStopClick() {\n\n  const intervalId = intervalRef.current;\n\n  clearInterval(intervalId);\n\n}\n\nBy using a ref, you ensure that:\n\nYou can store information between re-renders (unlike regular variables, which reset on every render).\nChanging it does not trigger a re-render (unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render).\nThe information is local to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).\n\nChanging a ref does not trigger a re-render, so refs are not appropriate for storing information you want to display on the screen. Use state for that instead. Read more about choosing between useRef and useState.\n\nExamples of referencing a value with useRef\n1. Click counter\n2. A stopwatch\nExample 1 of 2: Click counter \n\nThis component uses a ref to keep track of how many times the button was clicked. Note that it’s okay to use a ref instead of state here because the click count is only read and written in an event handler.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  let ref = useRef(0);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current = ref.current + 1;\n    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n      Click me!\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIf you show {ref.current} in the JSX, the number won’t update on click. This is because setting ref.current does not trigger a re-render. Information that’s used for rendering should be state instead.\n\nNext Example\nPitfall\n\nDo not write or read ref.current during rendering.\n\nReact expects that the body of your component behaves like a pure function:\n\nIf the inputs (props, state, and context) are the same, it should return exactly the same JSX.\nCalling it in a different order or with different arguments should not affect the results of other calls.\n\nReading or writing a ref during rendering breaks these expectations.\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  // 🚩 Don't write a ref during rendering\n\n  myRef.current = 123;\n\n  // ...\n\n  // 🚩 Don't read a ref during rendering\n\n  return <h1>{myOtherRef.current}</h1>;\n\n}\n\nYou can read or write refs from event handlers or effects instead.\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    // ✅ You can read or write refs in effects\n\n    myRef.current = 123;\n\n  });\n\n  // ...\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    // ✅ You can read or write refs in event handlers\n\n    doSomething(myOtherRef.current);\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIf you have to read or write something during rendering, use state instead.\n\nWhen you break these rules, your component might still work, but most of the newer features we’re adding to React will rely on these expectations. Read more about keeping your components pure.\n\nManipulating the DOM with a ref \n\nIt’s particularly common to use a ref to manipulate the DOM. React has built-in support for this.\n\nFirst, declare a ref object with an initial value of null:\n\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  // ...\n\nThen pass your ref object as the ref attribute to the JSX of the DOM node you want to manipulate:\n\n  // ...\n\n  return <input ref={inputRef} />;\n\nAfter React creates the DOM node and puts it on the screen, React will set the current property of your ref object to that DOM node. Now you can access the <input>’s DOM node and call methods like focus():\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    inputRef.current.focus();\n\n  }\n\nReact will set the current property back to null when the node is removed from the screen.\n\nRead more about manipulating the DOM with refs.\n\nExamples of manipulating the DOM with useRef\n1.

It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions. This argument is ignored after the initial render.\nIf you pass a function as initialState, it will be treated as an initializer function. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, and store its return value as the initial state. See an example below.\nReturns \n\nuseState returns an array with exactly two values:\n\nThe current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed.\nThe set function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.\nCaveats \nuseState is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your initializer function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your initializer function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.\nset functions, like setSomething(nextState) \n\nThe set function returned by useState lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You can pass the next state directly, or a function that calculates it from the previous state:\n\nconst [name, setName] = useState('Edward');\n\n\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setName('Taylor');\n\n  setAge(a => a + 1);\n\n  // ...\nParameters \nnextState: The value that you want the state to be. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions.\nIf you pass a function as nextState, it will be treated as an updater function. It must be pure, should take the pending state as its only argument, and should return the next state. React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state. See an example below.\nReturns \n\nset functions do not have a return value.\n\nCaveats \n\nThe set function only updates the state variable for the next render. If you read the state variable after calling the set function, you will still get the old value that was on the screen before your call.\n\nIf the new value you provide is identical to the current state, as determined by an Object.is comparison, React will skip re-rendering the component and its children. This is an optimization. Although in some cases React may still need to call your component before skipping the children, it shouldn’t affect your code.\n\nReact batches state updates. It updates the screen after all the event handlers have run and have called their set functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use flushSync.\n\nThe set function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.\n\nCalling the set function during rendering is only allowed from within the currently rendering component. React will discard its output and immediately attempt to render it again with the new state. This pattern is rarely needed, but you can use it to store information from the previous renders. See an example below.\n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your updater function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your updater function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.\n\nUsage \nAdding state to a component \n\nCall useState at the top level of your component to declare one or more state variables.\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\n  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  // ...\n\nThe convention is to name state variables like [something, setSomething] using array destructuring.\n\nuseState returns an array with exactly two items:\n\nThe current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.\nThe set function that lets you change it to any other value in response to interaction.\n\nTo update what’s on the screen, call the set function with some next state:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setName('Robin');\n\n}\n\nReact will store the next state, render your component again with the new values, and update the UI.\n\nPitfall\n\nCalling the set function does not change the current state in the already executing code:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setName('Robin');\n\n  console.log(name); // Still \"Taylor\"!\n\n}\n\nIt only affects what useState will return starting from the next render.\n\nBasic useState examples\n1. Counter (number)\n2. Text field (string)\n3. Checkbox (boolean)\n4. Form (two variables)\nExample 1 of 4: Counter (number) \n\nIn this example, the count state variable holds a number. Clicking the button increments it.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n      You pressed me {count} times\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nNext Example\nUpdating state based on the previous state \n\nSuppose the age is 42. This handler calls setAge(age + 1) three times:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)\n\n  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)\n\n  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)\n\n}\n\nHowever, after one click, age will only be 43 rather than 45! This is because calling the set function does not update the age state variable in the already running code. So each setAge(age + 1) call becomes setAge(43).\n\nTo solve this problem, you may pass an updater function to setAge instead of the next state:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(42 => 43)\n\n  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(43 => 44)\n\n  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(44 => 45)\n\n}\n\nHere, a => a + 1 is your updater function. It takes the pending state and calculates the next state from it.\n\nReact puts your updater functions in a queue. Then, during the next render, it will call them in the same order:\n\na => a + 1 will receive 42 as the pending state and return 43 as the next state.\na => a + 1 will receive 43 as the pending state and return 44 as the next state.\na => a + 1 will receive 44 as the pending state and return 45 as the next state.\n\nThere are no other queued updates, so React will store 45 as the current state in the end.\n\nBy convention, it’s common to name the pending state argument for the first letter of the state variable name, like a for age. However, you may also call it like prevAge or something else that you find clearer.\n\nReact may call your updaters twice in development to verify that they are pure.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nIs using an updater always preferred? \nShow Details\nThe difference between passing an updater and passing the next state directly\n1. Passing the updater function\n2. Passing the next state directly\nExample 1 of 2: Passing the updater function \n\nThis example passes the updater function, so the “+3” button works.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\n  function increment() {\n    setAge(a => a + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Your age: {age}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        increment();\n        increment();\n        increment();\n      }}>+3</button>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        increment();\n      }}>+1</button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nUpdating objects and arrays in state \n\nYou can put objects and arrays into state. In React, state is considered read-only, so you should replace it rather than mutate your existing objects. For example, if you have a form object in state, don’t mutate it:\n\n// 🚩 Don't mutate an object in state like this:\n\nform.firstName = 'Taylor';\n\nInstead, replace the whole object by creating a new one:\n\n// ✅ Replace state with a new object\n\nsetForm({\n\n  ...form,\n\n  firstName: 'Taylor'\n\n});\n\nRead updating objects in state and updating arrays in state to learn more.\n\nExamples of objects and arrays in state\n1. Form (object)\n2. Form (nested object)\n3. List (array)\n4. Writing concise update logic with Immer\nExample 1 of 4: Form (object) \n\nIn this example, the form state variable holds an object. Each input has a change handler that calls setForm with the next state of the entire form. The { ...form } spread syntax ensures that the state object is replaced rather than mutated.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [form, setForm] = useState({\n    firstName: 'Barbara',\n    lastName: 'Hepworth',\n    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        First name:\n        <input\n          value={form.firstName}\n          onChange={e => {\n            setForm({\n              ...form,\n              firstName: e.target.value\n            });\n          }}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Last name:\n        <input\n          value={form.lastName}\n          onChange={e => {\n            setForm({\n              ...form,\n              lastName: e.target.value\n            });\n          }}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Email:\n        <input\n          value={form.email}\n          onChange={e => {\n            setForm({\n              ...form,\n              email: e.target.value\n            });\n          }}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <p>\n        {form.firstName}{' '}\n        {form.lastName}{' '}\n        ({form.email})\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nAvoiding recreating the initial state \n\nReact saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos());\n\n  // ...\n\nAlthough the result of createInitialTodos() is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.\n\nTo solve this, you may pass it as an initializer function to useState instead:\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos);\n\n  // ...\n\nNotice that you’re passing createInitialTodos, which is the function itself, and not createInitialTodos(), which is the result of calling it. If you pass a function to useState, React will only call it during initialization.\n\nReact may call your initializers twice in development to verify that they are pure.\n\nThe difference between passing an initializer and passing the initial state directly\n1. Passing the initializer function\n2. Passing the initial state directly\nExample 1 of 2: Passing the initializer function \n\nThis example passes the initializer function, so the createInitialTodos function only runs during initialization. It does not run when component re-renders, such as when you type into the input.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction createInitialTodos() {\n  const initialTodos = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {\n    initialTodos.push({\n      id: i,\n      text: 'Item ' + (i + 1)\n    });\n  }\n  return initialTodos;\n}\n\nexport default function TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos);\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input\n        value={text}\n        onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setText('');\n        setTodos([{\n          id: todos.length,\n          text: text\n        }, ...todos]);\n      }}>Add</button>\n      <ul>\n        {todos.map(item => (\n          <li key={item.id}>\n            {item.text}\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nResetting state with a key \n\nYou’ll often encounter the key attribute when rendering lists. However, it also serves another purpose.\n\nYou can reset a component’s state by passing a different key to a component. In this example, the Reset button changes the version state variable, which we pass as a key to the Form. When the key changes, React re-creates the Form component (and all of its children) from scratch, so its state gets reset.\n\nRead preserving and resetting state to learn more.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [version, setVersion] = useState(0);\n\n  function handleReset() {\n    setVersion(version + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>\n      <Form key={version} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input\n        value={name}\n        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <p>Hello, {name}.</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nStoring information from previous renders \n\nUsually, you will update state in event handlers. However, in rare cases you might want to adjust state in response to rendering — for example, you might want to change a state variable when a prop changes.\n\nIn most cases, you don’t need this:\n\nIf the value you need can be computed entirely from the current props or other state, remove that redundant state altogether. If you’re worried about recomputing too often, the useMemo Hook can help.\nIf you want to reset the entire component tree’s state, pass a different key to your component.\nIf you can, update all the relevant state in the event handlers.\n\nIn the rare case that none of these apply, there is a pattern you can use to update state based on the values that have been rendered so far, by calling a set function while your component is rendering.\n\nHere’s an example. This CountLabel component displays the count prop passed to it:\n\nexport default function CountLabel({ count }) {\n\n  return <h1>{count}</h1>\n\n}\n\nSay you want to show whether the counter has increased or decreased since the last change. The count prop doesn’t tell you this — you need to keep track of its previous value. Add the prevCount state variable to track it. Add another state variable called trend to hold whether the count has increased or decreased. Compare prevCount with count, and if they’re not equal, update both prevCount and trend. Now you can show both the current count prop and how it has changed since the last render.\n\nApp.js\nCountLabel.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function CountLabel({ count }) {\n  const [prevCount, setPrevCount] = useState(count);\n  const [trend, setTrend] = useState(null);\n  if (prevCount !== count) {\n    setPrevCount(count);\n    setTrend(count > prevCount ? 'increasing' : 'decreasing');\n  }\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{count}</h1>\n      {trend && <p>The count is {trend}</p>}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNote that if you call a set function while rendering, it must be inside a condition like prevCount !== count, and there must be a call like setPrevCount(count) inside of the condition. Otherwise, your component would re-render in a loop until it crashes. Also, you can only update the state of the currently rendering component like this. Calling the set function of another component during rendering is an error. Finally, your set call should still update state without mutation — this doesn’t mean you can break other rules of pure functions.\n\nThis pattern can be hard to understand and is usually best avoided. However, it’s better than updating state in an effect. When you call the set function during render, React will re-render that component immediately after your component exits with a return statement, and before rendering the children. This way, children don’t need to render twice. The rest of your component function will still execute (and the result will be thrown away). If your condition is below all the Hook calls, you may add an early return; to restart rendering earlier.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI’ve updated the state, but logging gives me the old value \n\nCalling the set function does not change state in the running code:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  console.log(count);  // 0\n\n\n\n  setCount(count + 1); // Request a re-render with 1\n\n  console.log(count);  // Still 0!\n\n\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    console.log(count); // Also 0!\n\n  }, 5000);\n\n}\n\nThis is because states behaves like a snapshot. Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the count JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.\n\nIf you need to use the next state, you can save it in a variable before passing it to the set function:\n\nconst nextCount = count + 1;\n\nsetCount(nextCount);\n\n\n\nconsole.log(count);     // 0\n\nconsole.log(nextCount); // 1\nI’ve updated the state, but the screen doesn’t update \n\nReact will ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state, as determined by an Object.is comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:\n\nobj.x = 10;  // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object\n\nsetObj(obj); // 🚩 Doesn't do anything\n\nYou mutated an existing obj object and passed it back to setObj, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you’re always replacing objects and arrays in state instead of mutating them:\n\n// ✅ Correct: creating a new object\n\nsetObj({\n\n  ...obj,\n\n  x: 10\n\n});\nI’m getting an error: “Too many re-renders” \n\nYou might get an error that says: Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop. Typically, this means that you’re unconditionally setting state during render, so your component enters a loop: render, set state (which causes a render), render, set state (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: calls the handler during render\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: passes down the event handler\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: passes down an inline function\n\nreturn <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>\n\nIf you can’t find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific set function call responsible for the error.\n\nMy initializer or updater function runs twice \n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  // This component function will run twice for every render.\n\n\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => {\n\n    // This initializer function will run twice during initialization.\n\n    return createTodos();\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    setTodos(prevTodos => {\n\n      // This updater function will run twice for every click.\n\n      return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is expected and shouldn’t break your code.\n\nThis development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and updater functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.\n\nFor example, this impure updater function mutates an array in state:\n\nsetTodos(prevTodos => {\n\n  // 🚩 Mistake: mutating state\n\n  prevTodos.push(createTodo());\n\n});\n\nBecause React calls your updater function twice, you’ll see the todo was added twice, so you’ll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by replacing the array instead of mutating it:\n\nsetTodos(prevTodos => {\n\n  // ✅ Correct: replacing with new state\n\n  return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];\n\n});\n\nNow that this updater function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn’t make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. Only component, initializer, and updater functions need to be pure. Event handlers don’t need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.\n\nRead keeping components pure to learn more.\n\nI’m trying to set state to a function, but it gets called instead \n\nYou can’t put a function into state like this:\n\nconst [fn, setFn] = useState(someFunction);\n\n\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setFn(someOtherFunction);\n\n}\n\nBecause you’re passing a function, React assumes that someFunction is an initializer function, and that someOtherFunction is an updater function, so it tries to call them and store the result. To actually store a function, you have to put () => before them in both cases. Then React will store the functions you pass.\n\nconst [fn, setFn] = useState(() => someFunction);\n\n\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setFn(() => someOtherFunction);\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\nuseRef\nNEXT\nuseSyncExternalStore"

You need to pass two functions as arguments:\n\nThe subscribe function should subscribe to the store and return a function that unsubscribes.\nThe getSnapshot function should read a snapshot of the data from the store.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nsubscribe: A function that takes a single callback argument and subscribes it to the store. When the store changes, it should invoke the provided callback, which will cause React to re-call getSnapshot and (if needed) re-render the component. The subscribe function should return a function that cleans up the subscription.\n\ngetSnapshot: A function that returns a snapshot of the data in the store that’s needed by the component. While the store has not changed, repeated calls to getSnapshot must return the same value. If the store changes and the returned value is different (as compared by Object.is), React re-renders the component.\n\noptional getServerSnapshot: A function that returns the initial snapshot of the data in the store. It will be used only during server rendering and during hydration of server-rendered content on the client. The server snapshot must be the same between the client and the server, and is usually serialized and passed from the server to the client. If you omit this argument, rendering the component on the server will throw an error.\n\nReturns \n\nThe current snapshot of the store which you can use in your rendering logic.\n\nCaveats \n\nThe store snapshot returned by getSnapshot must be immutable. If the underlying store has mutable data, return a new immutable snapshot if the data has changed. Otherwise, return a cached last snapshot.\n\nIf a different subscribe function is passed during a re-render, React will re-subscribe to the store using the newly passed subscribe function. You can prevent this by declaring subscribe outside the component.\n\nIf the store is mutated during a non-blocking Transition update, React will fall back to performing that update as blocking. Specifically, for every Transition update, React will call getSnapshot a second time just before applying changes to the DOM. If it returns a different value than when it was called originally, React will restart the update from scratch, this time applying it as a blocking update, to ensure that every component on screen is reflecting the same version of the store.\n\nIt’s not recommended to suspend a render based on a store value returned by useSyncExternalStore. The reason is that mutations to the external store cannot be marked as non-blocking Transition updates, so they will trigger the nearest Suspense fallback, replacing already-rendered content on screen with a loading spinner, which typically makes a poor UX.\n\nFor example, the following are discouraged:\n\nconst LazyProductDetailPage = lazy(() => import('./ProductDetailPage.js'));\n\n\n\nfunction ShoppingApp() {\n\n  const selectedProductId = useSyncExternalStore(...);\n\n\n\n  // ❌ Calling `use` with a Promise dependent on `selectedProductId`\n\n  const data = use(fetchItem(selectedProductId))\n\n\n\n  // ❌ Conditionally rendering a lazy component based on `selectedProductId`\n\n  return selectedProductId != null ? <LazyProductDetailPage /> : <FeaturedProducts />;\n\n}\nUsage \nSubscribing to an external store \n\nMost of your React components will only read data from their props, state, and context. However, sometimes a component needs to read some data from some store outside of React that changes over time. This includes:\n\nThird-party state management libraries that hold state outside of React.\nBrowser APIs that expose a mutable value and events to subscribe to its changes.\n\nCall useSyncExternalStore at the top level of your component to read a value from an external data store.\n\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\nimport { todosStore } from './todoStore.js';\n\n\n\nfunction TodosApp() {\n\n  const todos = useSyncExternalStore(todosStore.subscribe, todosStore.getSnapshot);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIt returns the snapshot of the data in the store. You need to pass two functions as arguments:\n\nThe subscribe function should subscribe to the store and return a function that unsubscribes.\nThe getSnapshot function should read a snapshot of the data from the store.\n\nReact will use these functions to keep your component subscribed to the store and re-render it on changes.\n\nFor example, in the sandbox below, todosStore is implemented as an external store that stores data outside of React. The TodosApp component connects to that external store with the useSyncExternalStore Hook.\n\nApp.js\ntodoStore.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\nimport { todosStore } from './todoStore.js';\n\nexport default function TodosApp() {\n  const todos = useSyncExternalStore(todosStore.subscribe, todosStore.getSnapshot);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => todosStore.addTodo()}>Add todo</button>\n      <hr />\n      <ul>\n        {todos.map(todo => (\n          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nWhen possible, we recommend using built-in React state with useState and useReducer instead. The useSyncExternalStore API is mostly useful if you need to integrate with existing non-React code.\n\nSubscribing to a browser API \n\nAnother reason to add useSyncExternalStore is when you want to subscribe to some value exposed by the browser that changes over time. For example, suppose that you want your component to display whether the network connection is active. The browser exposes this information via a property called navigator.onLine.\n\nThis value can change without React’s knowledge, so you should read it with useSyncExternalStore.\n\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatIndicator() {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nTo implement the getSnapshot function, read the current value from the browser API:\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  return navigator.onLine;\n\n}\n\nNext, you need to implement the subscribe function. For example, when navigator.onLine changes, the browser fires the online and offline events on the window object. You need to subscribe the callback argument to the corresponding events, and then return a function that cleans up the subscriptions:\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n\n  return () => {\n\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n\n  };\n\n}\n\nNow React knows how to read the value from the external navigator.onLine API and how to subscribe to its changes. Disconnect your device from the network and notice that the component re-renders in response:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\nexport default function ChatIndicator() {\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n  return navigator.onLine;\n}\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n  return () => {\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n  };\n}\n\n\nShow more\nExtracting the logic to a custom Hook \n\nUsually you won’t write useSyncExternalStore directly in your components. Instead, you’ll typically call it from your own custom Hook. This lets you use the same external store from different components.\n\nFor example, this custom useOnlineStatus Hook tracks whether the network is online:\n\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport function useOnlineStatus() {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n  return isOnline;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNow different components can call useOnlineStatus without repeating the underlying implementation:\n\nApp.js\nuseOnlineStatus.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useOnlineStatus } from './useOnlineStatus.js';\n\nfunction StatusBar() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction SaveButton() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  function handleSaveClick() {\n    console.log('✅ Progress saved');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>\n      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <SaveButton />\n      <StatusBar />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nAdding support for server rendering \n\nIf your React app uses server rendering, your React components will also run outside the browser environment to generate the initial HTML. This creates a few challenges when connecting to an external store:\n\nIf you’re connecting to a browser-only API, it won’t work because it does not exist on the server.\nIf you’re connecting to a third-party data store, you’ll need its data to match between the server and client.\n\nTo solve these issues, pass a getServerSnapshot function as the third argument to useSyncExternalStore:\n\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport function useOnlineStatus() {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot);\n\n  return isOnline;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  return navigator.onLine;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction getServerSnapshot() {\n\n  return true; // Always show \"Online\" for server-generated HTML\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThe getServerSnapshot function is similar to getSnapshot, but it runs only in two situations:\n\nIt runs on the server when generating the HTML.\nIt runs on the client during hydration, i.e. when React takes the server HTML and makes it interactive.\n\nThis lets you provide the initial snapshot value which will be used before the app becomes interactive. If there is no meaningful initial value for the server rendering, omit this argument to force rendering on the client.\n\nNote\n\nMake sure that getServerSnapshot returns the same exact data on the initial client render as it returned on the server. For example, if getServerSnapshot returned some prepopulated store content on the server, you need to transfer this content to the client. One way to do this is to emit a <script> tag during server rendering that sets a global like window.MY_STORE_DATA, and read from that global on the client in getServerSnapshot. Your external store should provide instructions on how to do that.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI’m getting an error: “The result of getSnapshot should be cached” \n\nThis error means your getSnapshot function returns a new object every time it’s called, for example:\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  // 🔴 Do not return always different objects from getSnapshot\n\n  return {\n\n    todos: myStore.todos\n\n  };\n\n}\n\nReact will re-render the component if getSnapshot return value is different from the last time. This is why, if you always return a different value, you will enter an infinite loop and get this error.\n\nYour getSnapshot object should only return a different object if something has actually changed. If your store contains immutable data, you can return that data directly:\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  // ✅ You can return immutable data\n\n  return myStore.todos;\n\n}\n\nIf your store data is mutable, your getSnapshot function should return an immutable snapshot of it. This means it does need to create new objects, but it shouldn’t do this for every single call. Instead, it should store the last calculated snapshot, and return the same snapshot as the last time if the data in the store has not changed. How you determine whether mutable data has changed depends on your mutable store.\n\nMy subscribe function gets called after every re-render \n\nThis subscribe function is defined inside a component so it is different on every re-render:\n\nfunction ChatIndicator() {\n\n  // 🚩 Always a different function, so React will resubscribe on every re-render\n\n  function subscribe() {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n  \n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nReact will resubscribe to your store if you pass a different subscribe function between re-renders. If this causes performance issues and you’d like to avoid resubscribing, move the subscribe function outside:\n\n// ✅ Always the same function, so React won't need to resubscribe\n\nfunction subscribe() {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction ChatIndicator() {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, wrap subscribe into useCallback to only resubscribe when some argument changes:\n\nfunction ChatIndicator({ userId }) {\n\n  // ✅ Same function as long as userId doesn't change\n\n  const subscribe = useCallback(() => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }, [userId]);\n\n  \n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\nuseState\nNEXT\nuseTransition"

React calls action immediately with no parameters and marks all state updates scheduled synchronously during the action function call as Transitions. Any async calls that are awaited in the action will be included in the Transition, but currently require wrapping any set functions after the await in an additional startTransition (see Troubleshooting). State updates marked as Transitions will be non-blocking and will not display unwanted loading indicators.\nReturns \n\nstartTransition does not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nuseTransition is a Hook, so it can only be called inside components or custom Hooks. If you need to start a Transition somewhere else (for example, from a data library), call the standalone startTransition instead.\n\nYou can wrap an update into a Transition only if you have access to the set function of that state. If you want to start a Transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook value, try useDeferredValue instead.\n\nThe function you pass to startTransition is called immediately, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as Transitions. If you try to perform state updates in a setTimeout, for example, they won’t be marked as Transitions.\n\nYou must wrap any state updates after any async requests in another startTransition to mark them as Transitions. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see Troubleshooting).\n\nThe startTransition function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.\n\nA state update marked as a Transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a Transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input update.\n\nTransition updates can’t be used to control text inputs.\n\nIf there are multiple ongoing Transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation that may be removed in a future release.\n\nUsage \nPerform non-blocking updates with Actions \n\nCall useTransition at the top of your component to create Actions, and access the pending state:\n\nimport {useState, useTransition} from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction CheckoutForm() {\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nuseTransition returns an array with exactly two items:\n\nThe isPending flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition.\nThe startTransition function that lets you create an Action.\n\nTo start a Transition, pass a function to startTransition like this:\n\nimport {useState, useTransition} from 'react';\n\nimport {updateQuantity} from './api';\n\n\n\nfunction CheckoutForm() {\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);\n\n\n\n  function onSubmit(newQuantity) {\n\n    startTransition(async function () {\n\n      const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity);\n\n      startTransition(() => {\n\n        setQuantity(savedQuantity);\n\n      });\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThe function passed to startTransition is called the “Action”. You can update state and (optionally) perform side effects within an Action, and the work will be done in the background without blocking user interactions on the page. A Transition can include multiple Actions, and while a Transition is in progress, your UI stays responsive. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then changes their mind and clicks another tab, the second click will be immediately handled without waiting for the first update to finish.\n\nTo give the user feedback about in-progress Transitions, the isPending state switches to true at the first call to startTransition, and stays true until all Actions complete and the final state is shown to the user. Transitions ensure side effects in Actions to complete in order to prevent unwanted loading indicators, and you can provide immediate feedback while the Transition is in progress with useOptimistic.\n\nThe difference between Actions and regular event handling\n1. Updating the quantity in an Action\n2. Updating the quantity without an Action\nExample 1 of 2: Updating the quantity in an Action \n\nIn this example, the updateQuantity function simulates a request to the server to update the item’s quantity in the cart. This function is artificially slowed down so that it takes at least a second to complete the request.\n\nUpdate the quantity multiple times quickly. Notice that the pending “Total” state is shown while any requests are in progress, and the “Total” updates only after the final request is complete. Because the update is in an Action, the “quantity” can continue to be updated while the request is in progress.\n\nApp.js\nItem.js\nTotal.js\napi.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useTransition } from \"react\";\nimport { updateQuantity } from \"./api\";\nimport Item from \"./Item\";\nimport Total from \"./Total\";\n\nexport default function App({}) {\n  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  const updateQuantityAction = async newQuantity => {\n    // To access the pending state of a transition,\n    // call startTransition again.\n    startTransition(async () => {\n      const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity);\n      startTransition(() => {\n        setQuantity(savedQuantity);\n      });\n    });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Checkout</h1>\n      <Item action={updateQuantityAction}/>\n      <hr />\n      <Total quantity={quantity} isPending={isPending} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis is a basic example to demonstrate how Actions work, but this example does not handle requests completing out of order. When updating the quantity multiple times, it’s possible for the previous requests to finish after later requests causing the quantity to update out of order. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see Troubleshooting below).\n\nFor common use cases, React provides built-in abstractions such as:\n\nuseActionState\n<form> actions\nServer Functions\n\nThese solutions handle request ordering for you. When using Transitions to build your own custom hooks or libraries that manage async state transitions, you have greater control over the request ordering, but you must handle it yourself.\n\nNext Example\nExposing action prop from components \n\nYou can expose an action prop from a component to allow a parent to call an Action.\n\nFor example, this TabButton component wraps its onClick logic in an action prop:\n\nexport default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  if (isActive) {\n\n    return <b>{children}</b>\n\n  }\n\n  return (\n\n    <button onClick={() => {\n\n      startTransition(async () => {\n\n        // await the action that's passed in.\n\n        // This allows it to be either sync or async.\n\n        await action();\n\n      });\n\n    }}>\n\n      {children}\n\n    </button>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nBecause the parent component updates its state inside the action, that state update gets marked as a Transition. This means you can click on “Posts” and then immediately click “Contact” and it does not block user interactions:\n\nApp.js\nTabButton.js\nAboutTab.js\nPostsTab.js\nContactTab.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useTransition } from 'react';\n\nexport default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n  if (isActive) {\n    return <b>{children}</b>\n  }\n  if (isPending) {\n    return <b className=\"pending\">{children}</b>;\n  }\n  return (\n    <button onClick={async () => {\n      startTransition(async () => {\n        // await the action that's passed in.\n        // This allows it to be either sync or async.\n        await action();\n      });\n    }}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nWhen exposing an action prop from a component, you should await it inside the transition.\n\nThis allows the action callback to be either synchronous or asynchronous without requiring an additional startTransition to wrap the await in the action.\n\nDisplaying a pending visual state \n\nYou can use the isPending boolean value returned by useTransition to indicate to the user that a Transition is in progress. For example, the tab button can have a special “pending” visual state:\n\nfunction TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  // ...\n\n  if (isPending) {\n\n    return <b className=\"pending\">{children}</b>;\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nNotice how clicking “Posts” now feels more responsive because the tab button itself updates right away:\n\nApp.js\nTabButton.js\nAboutTab.js\nPostsTab.js\nContactTab.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useTransition } from 'react';\n\nexport default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n  if (isActive) {\n    return <b>{children}</b>\n  }\n  if (isPending) {\n    return <b className=\"pending\">{children}</b>;\n  }\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => {\n      startTransition(async () => {\n        await action();\n      });\n    }}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPreventing unwanted loading indicators \n\nIn this example, the PostsTab component fetches some data using use. When you click the “Posts” tab, the PostsTab component suspends, causing the closest loading fallback to appear:\n\nApp.js\nTabButton.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState } from 'react';\nimport TabButton from './TabButton.js';\nimport AboutTab from './AboutTab.js';\nimport PostsTab from './PostsTab.js';\nimport ContactTab from './ContactTab.js';\n\nexport default function TabContainer() {\n  const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<h1>🌀 Loading...</h1>}>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={tab === 'about'}\n        action={() => setTab('about')}\n      >\n        About\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={tab === 'posts'}\n        action={() => setTab('posts')}\n      >\n        Posts\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={tab === 'contact'}\n        action={() => setTab('contact')}\n      >\n        Contact\n      </TabButton>\n      <hr />\n      {tab === 'about' && <AboutTab />}\n      {tab === 'posts' && <PostsTab />}\n      {tab === 'contact' && <ContactTab />}\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHiding the entire tab container to show a loading indicator leads to a jarring user experience. If you add useTransition to TabButton, you can instead display the pending state in the tab button instead.\n\nNotice that clicking “Posts” no longer replaces the entire tab container with a spinner:\n\nApp.js\nTabButton.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useTransition } from 'react';\n\nexport default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n  if (isActive) {\n    return <b>{children}</b>\n  }\n  if (isPending) {\n    return <b className=\"pending\">{children}</b>;\n  }\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => {\n      startTransition(async () => {\n        await action();\n      });\n    }}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nRead more about using Transitions with Suspense.\n\nNote\n\nTransitions only “wait” long enough to avoid hiding already revealed content (like the tab container). If the Posts tab had a nested <Suspense> boundary, the Transition would not “wait” for it.\n\nBuilding a Suspense-enabled router \n\nIf you’re building a React framework or a router, we recommend marking page navigations as Transitions.\n\nfunction Router() {\n\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n\n    startTransition(() => {\n\n      setPage(url);\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is recommended for three reasons:\n\nTransitions are interruptible, which lets the user click away without waiting for the re-render to complete.\nTransitions prevent unwanted loading indicators, which lets the user avoid jarring jumps on navigation.\nTransitions wait for all pending actions which lets the user wait for side effects to complete before the new page is shown.\n\nHere is a simplified router example using Transitions for navigations.\n\nApp.js\nLayout.js\nIndexPage.js\nArtistPage.js\nAlbums.js\nBiography.js\nPanel.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useTransition } from 'react';\nimport IndexPage from './IndexPage.js';\nimport ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js';\nimport Layout from './Layout.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n      <Router />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Router() {\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setPage(url);\n    });\n  }\n\n  let content;\n  if (page === '/') {\n    content = (\n      <IndexPage navigate={navigate} />\n    );\n  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {\n    content = (\n      <ArtistPage\n        artist={{\n          id: 'the-beatles',\n          name: 'The Beatles',\n        }}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <Layout isPending={isPending}>\n      {content}\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nSuspense-enabled routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into Transitions by default.\n\nDisplaying an error to users with an error boundary \n\nIf a function passed to startTransition throws an error, you can display an error to your user with an error boundary. To use an error boundary, wrap the component where you are calling the useTransition in an error boundary. Once the function passed to startTransition errors, the fallback for the error boundary will be displayed.\n\nAddCommentContainer.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useTransition } from \"react\";\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\nexport function AddCommentContainer() {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>⚠️Something went wrong</p>}>\n      <AddCommentButton />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction addComment(comment) {\n  // For demonstration purposes to show Error Boundary\n  if (comment == null) {\n    throw new Error(\"Example Error: An error thrown to trigger error boundary\");\n  }\n}\n\nfunction AddCommentButton() {\n  const [pending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      disabled={pending}\n      onClick={() => {\n        startTransition(() => {\n          // Intentionally not passing a comment\n          // so error gets thrown\n          addComment();\n        });\n      }}\n    >\n      Add comment\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nTroubleshooting \nUpdating an input in a Transition doesn’t work \n\nYou can’t use a Transition for a state variable that controls an input:\n\nconst [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n// ...\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // ❌ Can't use Transitions for controlled input state\n\n  startTransition(() => {\n\n    setText(e.target.value);\n\n  });\n\n}\n\n// ...\n\nreturn <input value={text} onChange={handleChange} />;\n\nThis is because Transitions are non-blocking, but updating an input in response to the change event should happen synchronously. If you want to run a Transition in response to typing, you have two options:\n\nYou can declare two separate state variables: one for the input state (which always updates synchronously), and one that you will update in a Transition. This lets you control the input using the synchronous state, and pass the Transition state variable (which will “lag behind” the input) to the rest of your rendering logic.\nAlternatively, you can have one state variable, and add useDeferredValue which will “lag behind” the real value. It will trigger non-blocking re-renders to “catch up” with the new value automatically.\nReact doesn’t treat my state update as a Transition \n\nWhen you wrap a state update in a Transition, make sure that it happens during the startTransition call:\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  // ✅ Setting state *during* startTransition call\n\n  setPage('/about');\n\n});\n\nThe function you pass to startTransition must be synchronous. You can’t mark an update as a Transition like this:\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  // ❌ Setting state *after* startTransition call\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    setPage('/about');\n\n  }, 1000);\n\n});\n\nInstead, you could do this:\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n\n  startTransition(() => {\n\n    // ✅ Setting state *during* startTransition call\n\n    setPage('/about');\n\n  });\n\n}, 1000);\nReact doesn’t treat my state update after await as a Transition \n\nWhen you use await inside a startTransition function, the state updates that happen after the await are not marked as Transitions. You must wrap state updates after each await in a startTransition call:\n\nstartTransition(async () => {\n\n  await someAsyncFunction();\n\n  // ❌ Not using startTransition after await\n\n  setPage('/about');\n\n});\n\nHowever, this works instead:\n\nstartTransition(async () => {\n\n  await someAsyncFunction();\n\n  // ✅ Using startTransition *after* await\n\n  startTransition(() => {\n\n    setPage('/about');\n\n  });\n\n});\n\nThis is a JavaScript limitation due to React losing the scope of the async context. In the future, when AsyncContext is available, this limitation will be removed.\n\nI want to call useTransition from outside a component \n\nYou can’t call useTransition outside a component because it’s a Hook. In this case, use the standalone startTransition method instead. It works the same way, but it doesn’t provide the isPending indicator.\n\nThe function I pass to startTransition executes immediately \n\nIf you run this code, it will print 1, 2, 3:\n\nconsole.log(1);\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  console.log(2);\n\n  setPage('/about');\n\n});\n\nconsole.log(3);\n\nIt is expected to print 1, 2, 3. The function you pass to startTransition does not get delayed. Unlike with the browser setTimeout, it does not run the callback later. React executes your function immediately, but any state updates scheduled while it is running are marked as Transitions. You can imagine that it works like this:\n\n// A simplified version of how React works\n\n\n\nlet isInsideTransition = false;\n\n\n\nfunction startTransition(scope) {\n\n  isInsideTransition = true;\n\n  scope();\n\n  isInsideTransition = false;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction setState() {\n\n  if (isInsideTransition) {\n\n    // ... schedule a Transition state update ...\n\n  } else {\n\n    // ... schedule an urgent state update ...\n\n  }\n\n}\nMy state updates in Transitions are out of order \n\nIf you await inside startTransition, you might see the updates happen out of order.\n\nIn this example, the updateQuantity function simulates a request to the server to update the item’s quantity in the cart. This function artificially returns every other request after the previous to simulate race conditions for network requests.\n\nTry updating the quantity once, then update it quickly multiple times. You might see the incorrect total:\n\nApp.js\nItem.js\nTotal.js\napi.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useTransition } from \"react\";\nimport { updateQuantity } from \"./api\";\nimport Item from \"./Item\";\nimport Total from \"./Total\";\n\nexport default function App({}) {\n  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n  // Store the actual quantity in separate state to show the mismatch.\n  const [clientQuantity, setClientQuantity] = useState(1);\n\n  const updateQuantityAction = newQuantity => {\n    setClientQuantity(newQuantity);\n\n    // Access the pending state of the transition,\n    // by wrapping in startTransition again.\n    startTransition(async () => {\n      const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity);\n      startTransition(() => {\n        setQuantity(savedQuantity);\n      });\n    });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Checkout</h1>\n      <Item action={updateQuantityAction}/>\n      <hr />\n      <Total clientQuantity={clientQuantity} savedQuantity={quantity} isPending={isPending} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen clicking multiple times, it’s possible for previous requests to finish after later requests. When this happens, React currently has no way to know the intended order. This is because the updates are scheduled asynchronously, and React loses context of the order across the async boundary.\n\nThis is expected, because Actions within a Transition do not guarantee execution order. For common use cases, React provides higher-level abstractions like useActionState and <form> actions that handle ordering for you. For advanced use cases, you’ll need to implement your own queuing and abort logic to handle this.\n\nExample of useActionState handling execution order:\n\nApp.js\nItem.js\nTotal.js\napi.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useActionState } from \"react\";\nimport { updateQuantity } from \"./api\";\nimport Item from \"./Item\";\nimport Total from \"./Total\";\n\nexport default function App({}) {\n  // Store the actual quantity in separate state to show the mismatch.\n  const [clientQuantity, setClientQuantity] = useState(1);\n  const [quantity, updateQuantityAction, isPending] = useActionState(\n    async (prevState, payload) => {\n      setClientQuantity(payload);\n      const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(payload);\n      return savedQuantity; // Return the new quantity to update the state\n    },\n    1 // Initial quantity\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Checkout</h1>\n      <Item action={updateQuantityAction}/>\n      <hr />\n      <Total clientQuantity={clientQuantity} savedQuantity={quantity} isPending={isPending} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPREVIOUS\nuseSyncExternalStore\nNEXT\nComponents"

Grouping elements in Fragment has no effect on the resulting DOM; it is the same as if the elements were not grouped. The empty JSX tag <></> is shorthand for <Fragment></Fragment> in most cases.\n\nProps \noptional key: Fragments declared with the explicit <Fragment> syntax may have keys.\nCanary only optional ref: A ref object (e.g. from useRef) or callback function. React provides a FragmentInstance as the ref value that implements methods for interacting with the DOM nodes wrapped by the Fragment.\nCanary only FragmentInstance \n\nWhen you pass a ref to a fragment, React provides a FragmentInstance object with methods for interacting with the DOM nodes wrapped by the fragment:\n\nEvent handling methods:\n\naddEventListener(type, listener, options?): Adds an event listener to all first-level DOM children of the Fragment.\nremoveEventListener(type, listener, options?): Removes an event listener from all first-level DOM children of the Fragment.\ndispatchEvent(event): Dispatches an event to a virtual child of the Fragment to call any added listeners and can bubble to the DOM parent.\n\nLayout methods:\n\ncompareDocumentPosition(otherNode): Compares the document position of the Fragment with another node.\nIf the Fragment has children, the native compareDocumentPosition value is returned.\nEmpty Fragments will attempt to compare positioning within the React tree and include Node.DOCUMENT_POSITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC.\nElements that have a different relationship in the React tree and DOM tree due to portaling or other insertions are Node.DOCUMENT_POSITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC.\ngetClientRects(): Returns a flat array of DOMRect objects representing the bounding rectangles of all children.\ngetRootNode(): Returns the root node containing the Fragment’s parent DOM node.\n\nFocus management methods:\n\nfocus(options?): Focuses the first focusable DOM node in the Fragment. Focus is attempted on nested children depth-first.\nfocusLast(options?): Focuses the last focusable DOM node in the Fragment. Focus is attempted on nested children depth-first.\nblur(): Removes focus if document.activeElement is within the Fragment.\n\nObserver methods:\n\nobserveUsing(observer): Starts observing the Fragment’s DOM children with an IntersectionObserver or ResizeObserver.\nunobserveUsing(observer): Stops observing the Fragment’s DOM children with the specified observer.\nCaveats \n\nIf you want to pass key to a Fragment, you can’t use the <>...</> syntax. You have to explicitly import Fragment from 'react' and render <Fragment key={yourKey}>...</Fragment>.\n\nReact does not reset state when you go from rendering <><Child /></> to [<Child />] or back, or when you go from rendering <><Child /></> to <Child /> and back. This only works a single level deep: for example, going from <><><Child /></></> to <Child /> resets the state. See the precise semantics here.\n\nCanary only If you want to pass ref to a Fragment, you can’t use the <>...</> syntax. You have to explicitly import Fragment from 'react' and render <Fragment ref={yourRef}>...</Fragment>.\n\nUsage \nReturning multiple elements \n\nUse Fragment, or the equivalent <>...</> syntax, to group multiple elements together. You can use it to put multiple elements in any place where a single element can go. For example, a component can only return one element, but by using a Fragment you can group multiple elements together and then return them as a group:\n\nfunction Post() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <PostTitle />\n\n      <PostBody />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nFragments are useful because grouping elements with a Fragment has no effect on layout or styles, unlike if you wrapped the elements in another container like a DOM element. If you inspect this example with the browser tools, you’ll see that all <h1> and <article> DOM nodes appear as siblings without wrappers around them:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function Blog() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Post title=\"An update\" body=\"It's been a while since I posted...\" />\n      <Post title=\"My new blog\" body=\"I am starting a new blog!\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Post({ title, body }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <PostTitle title={title} />\n      <PostBody body={body} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction PostTitle({ title }) {\n  return <h1>{title}</h1>\n}\n\nfunction PostBody({ body }) {\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <p>{body}</p>\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDEEP DIVE\nHow to write a Fragment without the special syntax? \nShow Details\nAssigning multiple elements to a variable \n\nLike any other element, you can assign Fragment elements to variables, pass them as props, and so on:\n\nfunction CloseDialog() {\n\n  const buttons = (\n\n    <>\n\n      <OKButton />\n\n      <CancelButton />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n  return (\n\n    <AlertDialog buttons={buttons}>\n\n      Are you sure you want to leave this page?\n\n    </AlertDialog>\n\n  );\n\n}\nGrouping elements with text \n\nYou can use Fragment to group text together with components:\n\nfunction DateRangePicker({ start, end }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      From\n\n      <DatePicker date={start} />\n\n      to\n\n      <DatePicker date={end} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nRendering a list of Fragments \n\nHere’s a situation where you need to write Fragment explicitly instead of using the <></> syntax. When you render multiple elements in a loop, you need to assign a key to each element. If the elements within the loop are Fragments, you need to use the normal JSX element syntax in order to provide the key attribute:\n\nfunction Blog() {\n\n  return posts.map(post =>\n\n    <Fragment key={post.id}>\n\n      <PostTitle title={post.title} />\n\n      <PostBody body={post.body} />\n\n    </Fragment>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nYou can inspect the DOM to verify that there are no wrapper elements around the Fragment children:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Fragment } from 'react';\n\nconst posts = [\n  { id: 1, title: 'An update', body: \"It's been a while since I posted...\" },\n  { id: 2, title: 'My new blog', body: 'I am starting a new blog!' }\n];\n\nexport default function Blog() {\n  return posts.map(post =>\n    <Fragment key={post.id}>\n      <PostTitle title={post.title} />\n      <PostBody body={post.body} />\n    </Fragment>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction PostTitle({ title }) {\n  return <h1>{title}</h1>\n}\n\nfunction PostBody({ body }) {\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <p>{body}</p>\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nCanary only Using Fragment refs for DOM interaction \n\nFragment refs allow you to interact with the DOM nodes wrapped by a Fragment without adding extra wrapper elements. This is useful for event handling, visibility tracking, focus management, and replacing deprecated patterns like ReactDOM.findDOMNode().\n\nimport { Fragment } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ClickableFragment({ children, onClick }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <Fragment ref={fragmentInstance => {\n\n      fragmentInstance.addEventListener('click', handleClick);\n\n      return () => fragmentInstance.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);\n\n    }}>\n\n      {children}\n\n    </Fragment>\n\n  );\n\n}\nCanary only Tracking visibility with Fragment refs \n\nFragment refs are useful for visibility tracking and intersection observation. This enables you to monitor when content becomes visible without requiring the child Components to expose refs:\n\nimport { Fragment, useRef, useLayoutEffect } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction VisibilityObserverFragment({ threshold = 0.5, onVisibilityChange, children }) {\n\n  const fragmentRef = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n\n    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(\n\n      (entries) => {\n\n        onVisibilityChange(entries.some(entry => entry.isIntersecting))\n\n      },\n\n      { threshold }\n\n    );\n\n    \n\n    fragmentRef.current.observeUsing(observer);\n\n    return () => fragmentRef.current.unobserveUsing(observer);\n\n  }, [threshold, onVisibilityChange]);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <Fragment ref={fragmentRef}>\n\n      {children}\n\n    </Fragment>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const handleVisibilityChange = (isVisible) => {\n\n    console.log('Component is', isVisible ? 'visible' : 'hidden');\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <VisibilityObserverFragment onVisibilityChange={handleVisibilityChange}>\n\n      <SomeThirdPartyComponent />\n\n      <AnotherComponent />\n\n    </VisibilityObserverFragment>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis pattern is an alternative to Effect-based visibility logging, which is an anti-pattern in most cases. Relying on Effects alone does not guarantee that the rendered Component is observable by the user.\n\nCanary only Focus management with Fragment refs \n\nFragment refs provide focus management methods that work across all DOM nodes within the Fragment:\n\nimport { Fragment, useRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction FocusFragment({ children }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <Fragment ref={(fragmentInstance) => fragmentInstance?.focus()}>\n\n      {children}\n\n    </Fragment>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe focus() method focuses the first focusable element within the Fragment, while focusLast() focuses the last focusable element.\n\nPREVIOUS\nComponents\nNEXT\n<Profiler>"

It exposes similar functionality as a browser extension.\n\nComponents wrapped in <Profiler> will also be marked in the Component tracks of React Performance tracks even in profiling builds.\nIn development builds, all components are marked in the Components track regardless of whether they’re wrapped in <Profiler>.\n\nMeasuring different parts of the application \n\nYou can use multiple <Profiler> components to measure different parts of your application:\n\n<App>\n\n  <Profiler id=\"Sidebar\" onRender={onRender}>\n\n    <Sidebar />\n\n  </Profiler>\n\n  <Profiler id=\"Content\" onRender={onRender}>\n\n    <Content />\n\n  </Profiler>\n\n</App>\n\nYou can also nest <Profiler> components:\n\n<App>\n\n  <Profiler id=\"Sidebar\" onRender={onRender}>\n\n    <Sidebar />\n\n  </Profiler>\n\n  <Profiler id=\"Content\" onRender={onRender}>\n\n    <Content>\n\n      <Profiler id=\"Editor\" onRender={onRender}>\n\n        <Editor />\n\n      </Profiler>\n\n      <Preview />\n\n    </Content>\n\n  </Profiler>\n\n</App>\n\nAlthough <Profiler> is a lightweight component, it should be used only when necessary. Each use adds some CPU and memory overhead to an application.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<Fragment> (<>)\nNEXT\n<StrictMode>"

    "html": "API REFERENCE\nCOMPONENTS\n<StrictMode>\n\n<StrictMode> lets you find common bugs in your components early during development.\n\n<StrictMode>\n\n  <App />\n\n</StrictMode>\nReference\n<StrictMode>\nUsage\nEnabling Strict Mode for entire app\nEnabling Strict Mode for a part of the app\nFixing bugs found by double rendering in development\nFixing bugs found by re-running Effects in development\nFixing bugs found by re-running ref callbacks in development\nFixing deprecation warnings enabled by Strict Mode\nReference \n<StrictMode> \n\nUse StrictMode to enable additional development behaviors and warnings for the component tree inside:\n\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\n\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\n\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\n\nroot.render(\n\n  <StrictMode>\n\n    <App />\n\n  </StrictMode>\n\n);\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nStrict Mode enables the following development-only behaviors:\n\nYour components will re-render an extra time to find bugs caused by impure rendering.\nYour components will re-run Effects an extra time to find bugs caused by missing Effect cleanup.\nYour components will re-run refs callbacks an extra time to find bugs caused by missing ref cleanup.\nYour components will be checked for usage of deprecated APIs.\nProps \n\nStrictMode accepts no props.\n\nCaveats \nThere is no way to opt out of Strict Mode inside a tree wrapped in <StrictMode>. This gives you confidence that all components inside <StrictMode> are checked. If two teams working on a product disagree whether they find the checks valuable, they need to either reach consensus or move <StrictMode> down in the tree.\nUsage \nEnabling Strict Mode for entire app \n\nStrict Mode enables extra development-only checks for the entire component tree inside the <StrictMode> component. These checks help you find common bugs in your components early in the development process.\n\nTo enable Strict Mode for your entire app, wrap your root component with <StrictMode> when you render it:\n\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\n\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\n\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\n\nroot.render(\n\n  <StrictMode>\n\n    <App />\n\n  </StrictMode>\n\n);\n\nWe recommend wrapping your entire app in Strict Mode, especially for newly created apps. If you use a framework that calls createRoot for you, check its documentation for how to enable Strict Mode.\n\nAlthough the Strict Mode checks only run in development, they help you find bugs that already exist in your code but can be tricky to reliably reproduce in production. Strict Mode lets you fix bugs before your users report them.\n\nNote\n\nStrict Mode enables the following checks in development:\n\nYour components will re-render an extra time to find bugs caused by impure rendering.\nYour components will re-run Effects an extra time to find bugs caused by missing Effect cleanup.\nYour components will re-run ref callbacks an extra time to find bugs caused by missing ref cleanup.\nYour components will be checked for usage of deprecated APIs.\n\nAll of these checks are development-only and do not impact the production build.\n\nEnabling Strict Mode for a part of the app \n\nYou can also enable Strict Mode for any part of your application:\n\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <Header />\n\n      <StrictMode>\n\n        <main>\n\n          <Sidebar />\n\n          <Content />\n\n        </main>\n\n      </StrictMode>\n\n      <Footer />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn this example, Strict Mode checks will not run against the Header and Footer components. However, they will run on Sidebar and Content, as well as all of the components inside them, no matter how deep.\n\nNote\n\nWhen StrictMode is enabled for a part of the app, React will only enable behaviors that are possible in production. For example, if <StrictMode> is not enabled at the root of the app, it will not re-run Effects an extra time on initial mount, since this would cause child effects to double fire without the parent effects, which cannot happen in production.\n\nFixing bugs found by double rendering in development \n\nReact assumes that every component you write is a pure function. This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs (props, state, and context).\n\nComponents breaking this rule behave unpredictably and cause bugs. To help you find accidentally impure code, Strict Mode calls some of your functions (only the ones that should be pure) twice in development. This includes:\n\nYour component function body (only top-level logic, so this doesn’t include code inside event handlers)\nFunctions that you pass to useState, set functions, useMemo, or useReducer\nSome class component methods like constructor, render, shouldComponentUpdate (see the whole list)\n\nIf a function is pure, running it twice does not change its behavior because a pure function produces the same result every time. However, if a function is impure (for example, it mutates the data it receives), running it twice tends to be noticeable (that’s what makes it impure!) This helps you spot and fix the bug early.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate how double rendering in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early.\n\nThis StoryTray component takes an array of stories and adds one last “Create Story” item at the end:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nStoryTray.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n  const items = stories;\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(story => (\n        <li key={story.id}>\n          {story.label}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThere is a mistake in the code above. However, it is easy to miss because the initial output appears correct.\n\nThis mistake will become more noticeable if the StoryTray component re-renders multiple times. For example, let’s make the StoryTray re-render with a different background color whenever you hover over it:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nStoryTray.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n  const [isHover, setIsHover] = useState(false);\n  const items = stories;\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n  return (\n    <ul\n      onPointerEnter={() => setIsHover(true)}\n      onPointerLeave={() => setIsHover(false)}\n      style={{\n        backgroundColor: isHover ? '#ddd' : '#fff'\n      }}\n    >\n      {items.map(story => (\n        <li key={story.id}>\n          {story.label}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice how every time you hover over the StoryTray component, “Create Story” gets added to the list again. The intention of the code was to add it once at the end. But StoryTray directly modifies the stories array from the props. Every time StoryTray renders, it adds “Create Story” again at the end of the same array. In other words, StoryTray is not a pure function—running it multiple times produces different results.\n\nTo fix this problem, you can make a copy of the array, and modify that copy instead of the original one:\n\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n\n  const items = stories.slice(); // Clone the array\n\n  // ✅ Good: Pushing into a new array\n\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n\nThis would make the StoryTray function pure. Each time it is called, it would only modify a new copy of the array, and would not affect any external objects or variables. This solves the bug, but you had to make the component re-render more often before it became obvious that something is wrong with its behavior.\n\nIn the original example, the bug wasn’t obvious. Now let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in <StrictMode>:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nStoryTray.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n  const items = stories;\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(story => (\n        <li key={story.id}>\n          {story.label}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nStrict Mode always calls your rendering function twice, so you can see the mistake right away (“Create Story” appears twice). This lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your component to render in Strict Mode, you also fix many possible future production bugs like the hover functionality from before:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nStoryTray.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n  const [isHover, setIsHover] = useState(false);\n  const items = stories.slice(); // Clone the array\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n  return (\n    <ul\n      onPointerEnter={() => setIsHover(true)}\n      onPointerLeave={() => setIsHover(false)}\n      style={{\n        backgroundColor: isHover ? '#ddd' : '#fff'\n      }}\n    >\n      {items.map(story => (\n        <li key={story.id}>\n          {story.label}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWithout Strict Mode, it was easy to miss the bug until you added more re-renders. Strict Mode made the same bug appear right away. Strict Mode helps you find bugs before you push them to your team and to your users.\n\nRead more about keeping components pure.\n\nNote\n\nIf you have React DevTools installed, any console.log calls during the second render call will appear slightly dimmed. React DevTools also offers a setting (off by default) to suppress them completely.\n\nFixing bugs found by re-running Effects in development \n\nStrict Mode can also help find bugs in Effects.\n\nEvery Effect has some setup code and may have some cleanup code. Normally, React calls setup when the component mounts (is added to the screen) and calls cleanup when the component unmounts (is removed from the screen). React then calls cleanup and setup again if its dependencies changed since the last render.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will also run one extra setup+cleanup cycle in development for every Effect. This may feel surprising, but it helps reveal subtle bugs that are hard to catch manually.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate how re-running Effects in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early.\n\nConsider this example that connects a component to a chat:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport './styles.css';\n\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\"));\nroot.render(<App />);\n\n\n\nThere is an issue with this code, but it might not be immediately clear.\n\nTo make the issue more obvious, let’s implement a feature. In the example below, roomId is not hardcoded. Instead, the user can select the roomId that they want to connect to from a dropdown. Click “Open chat” and then select different chat rooms one by one. Keep track of the number of active connections in the console:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport './styles.css';\n\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\"));\nroot.render(<App />);\n\n\n\nYou’ll notice that the number of open connections always keeps growing. In a real app, this would cause performance and network problems. The issue is that your Effect is missing a cleanup function:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\nNow that your Effect “cleans up” after itself and destroys the outdated connections, the leak is solved. However, notice that the problem did not become visible until you’ve added more features (the select box).\n\nIn the original example, the bug wasn’t obvious. Now let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in <StrictMode>:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport './styles.css';\n\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\"));\nroot.render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </StrictMode>\n);\n\n\n\nWith Strict Mode, you immediately see that there is a problem (the number of active connections jumps to 2). Strict Mode runs an extra setup+cleanup cycle for every Effect. This Effect has no cleanup logic, so it creates an extra connection but doesn’t destroy it. This is a hint that you’re missing a cleanup function.\n\nStrict Mode lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your Effect by adding a cleanup function in Strict Mode, you also fix many possible future production bugs like the select box from before:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport './styles.css';\n\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\"));\nroot.render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </StrictMode>\n);\n\n\n\nNotice how the active connection count in the console doesn’t keep growing anymore.\n\nWithout Strict Mode, it was easy to miss that your Effect needed cleanup. By running setup → cleanup → setup instead of setup for your Effect in development, Strict Mode made the missing cleanup logic more noticeable.\n\nRead more about implementing Effect cleanup.\n\nFixing bugs found by re-running ref callbacks in development \n\nStrict Mode can also help find bugs in callbacks refs.\n\nEvery callback ref has some setup code and may have some cleanup code. Normally, React calls setup when the element is created (is added to the DOM) and calls cleanup when the element is removed (is removed from the DOM).\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will also run one extra setup+cleanup cycle in development for every callback ref. This may feel surprising, but it helps reveal subtle bugs that are hard to catch manually.\n\nConsider this example, which allows you to select an animal and then scroll to one of them. Notice when you switch from “Cats” to “Dogs”, the console logs show that the number of animals in the list keeps growing, and the “Scroll to” buttons stop working:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef, useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function CatFriends() {\n  const itemsRef = useRef([]);\n  const [catList, setCatList] = useState(setupCatList);\n  const [cat, setCat] = useState('neo');\n\n  function scrollToCat(index) {\n    const list = itemsRef.current;\n    const {node} = list[index];\n    node.scrollIntoView({\n      behavior: \"smooth\",\n      block: \"nearest\",\n      inline: \"center\",\n    });\n  }\n\n  const cats = catList.filter(c => c.type === cat)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <button onClick={() => setCat('neo')}>Neo</button>\n        <button onClick={() => setCat('millie')}>Millie</button>\n      </nav>\n      <hr />\n      <nav>\n        <span>Scroll to:</span>{cats.map((cat, index) => (\n          <button key={cat.src} onClick={() => scrollToCat(index)}>\n            {index}\n          </button>\n        ))}\n      </nav>\n      <div>\n        <ul>\n          {cats.map((cat) => (\n            <li\n              key={cat.src}\n              ref={(node) => {\n                const list = itemsRef.current;\n                const item = {cat: cat, node};\n                list.push(item);\n                console.log(`✅ Adding cat to the map. Total cats: ${list.length}`);\n                if (list.length > 10) {\n                  console.log('❌ Too many cats in the list!');\n                }\n                return () => {\n                  // 🚩 No cleanup, this is a bug!\n                }\n              }}\n            >\n              <img src={cat.src} />\n            </li>\n          ))}\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction setupCatList() {\n  const catList = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n    catList.push({type: 'neo', src: \"https://placecats.com/neo/320/240?\" + i});\n  }\n  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n    catList.push({type: 'millie', src: \"https://placecats.com/millie/320/240?\" + i});\n  }\n\n  return catList;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis is a production bug! Since the ref callback doesn’t remove animals from the list in the cleanup, the list of animals keeps growing.

If children suspends while rendering, the Suspense boundary will switch to rendering fallback.\nfallback: An alternate UI to render in place of the actual UI if it has not finished loading. Any valid React node is accepted, though in practice, a fallback is a lightweight placeholder view, such as a loading spinner or skeleton. Suspense will automatically switch to fallback when children suspends, and back to children when the data is ready. If fallback suspends while rendering, it will activate the closest parent Suspense boundary.\nCaveats \nReact does not preserve any state for renders that got suspended before they were able to mount for the first time. When the component has loaded, React will retry rendering the suspended tree from scratch.\nIf Suspense was displaying content for the tree, but then it suspended again, the fallback will be shown again unless the update causing it was caused by startTransition or useDeferredValue.\nIf React needs to hide the already visible content because it suspended again, it will clean up layout Effects in the content tree. When the content is ready to be shown again, React will fire the layout Effects again. This ensures that Effects measuring the DOM layout don’t try to do this while the content is hidden.\nReact includes under-the-hood optimizations like Streaming Server Rendering and Selective Hydration that are integrated with Suspense. Read an architectural overview and watch a technical talk to learn more.\nUsage \nDisplaying a fallback while content is loading \n\nYou can wrap any part of your application with a Suspense boundary:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <Albums />\n\n</Suspense>\n\nReact will display your loading fallback until all the code and data needed by the children has been loaded.\n\nIn the example below, the Albums component suspends while fetching the list of albums. Until it’s ready to render, React switches the closest Suspense boundary above to show the fallback—your Loading component. Then, when the data loads, React hides the Loading fallback and renders the Albums component with data.\n\nArtistPage.js\nAlbums.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport Albums from './Albums.js';\n\nexport default function ArtistPage({ artist }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n        <Albums artistId={artist.id} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Loading() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nOnly Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a cached Promise with use\n\nSuspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.\n\nThe exact way you would load data in the Albums component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.\n\nSuspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.\n\nRevealing content together at once \n\nBy default, the whole tree inside Suspense is treated as a single unit. For example, even if only one of these components suspends waiting for some data, all of them together will be replaced by the loading indicator:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <Biography />\n\n  <Panel>\n\n    <Albums />\n\n  </Panel>\n\n</Suspense>\n\nThen, after all of them are ready to be displayed, they will all appear together at once.\n\nIn the example below, both Biography and Albums fetch some data. However, because they are grouped under a single Suspense boundary, these components always “pop in” together at the same time.\n\nArtistPage.js\nPanel.js\nBiography.js\nAlbums.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport Albums from './Albums.js';\nimport Biography from './Biography.js';\nimport Panel from './Panel.js';\n\nexport default function ArtistPage({ artist }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n        <Biography artistId={artist.id} />\n        <Panel>\n          <Albums artistId={artist.id} />\n        </Panel>\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Loading() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nComponents that load data don’t have to be direct children of the Suspense boundary. For example, you can move Biography and Albums into a new Details component. This doesn’t change the behavior. Biography and Albums share the same closest parent Suspense boundary, so their reveal is coordinated together.\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <Details artistId={artist.id} />\n\n</Suspense>\n\n\n\nfunction Details({ artistId }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <Biography artistId={artistId} />\n\n      <Panel>\n\n        <Albums artistId={artistId} />\n\n      </Panel>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nRevealing nested content as it loads \n\nWhen a component suspends, the closest parent Suspense component shows the fallback. This lets you nest multiple Suspense components to create a loading sequence. Each Suspense boundary’s fallback will be filled in as the next level of content becomes available. For example, you can give the album list its own fallback:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n\n  <Biography />\n\n  <Suspense fallback={<AlbumsGlimmer />}>\n\n    <Panel>\n\n      <Albums />\n\n    </Panel>\n\n  </Suspense>\n\n</Suspense>\n\nWith this change, displaying the Biography doesn’t need to “wait” for the Albums to load.\n\nThe sequence will be:\n\nIf Biography hasn’t loaded yet, BigSpinner is shown in place of the entire content area.\nOnce Biography finishes loading, BigSpinner is replaced by the content.\nIf Albums hasn’t loaded yet, AlbumsGlimmer is shown in place of Albums and its parent Panel.\nFinally, once Albums finishes loading, it replaces AlbumsGlimmer.\nArtistPage.js\nPanel.js\nBiography.js\nAlbums.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport Albums from './Albums.js';\nimport Biography from './Biography.js';\nimport Panel from './Panel.js';\n\nexport default function ArtistPage({ artist }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n        <Biography artistId={artist.id} />\n        <Suspense fallback={<AlbumsGlimmer />}>\n          <Panel>\n            <Albums artistId={artist.id} />\n          </Panel>\n        </Suspense>\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\nfunction AlbumsGlimmer() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"glimmer-panel\">\n      <div className=\"glimmer-line\" />\n      <div className=\"glimmer-line\" />\n      <div className=\"glimmer-line\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nSuspense boundaries let you coordinate which parts of your UI should always “pop in” together at the same time, and which parts should progressively reveal more content in a sequence of loading states. You can add, move, or delete Suspense boundaries in any place in the tree without affecting the rest of your app’s behavior.\n\nDon’t put a Suspense boundary around every component. Suspense boundaries should not be more granular than the loading sequence that you want the user to experience. If you work with a designer, ask them where the loading states should be placed—it’s likely that they’ve already included them in their design wireframes.\n\nShowing stale content while fresh content is loading \n\nIn this example, the SearchResults component suspends while fetching the search results. Type \"a\", wait for the results, and then edit it to \"ab\". The results for \"a\" will get replaced by the loading fallback.\n\nApp.js\nSearchResults.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <SearchResults query={query} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nA common alternative UI pattern is to defer updating the list and to keep showing the previous results until the new results are ready. The useDeferredValue Hook lets you pass a deferred version of the query down:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <label>\n\n        Search albums:\n\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n\n      </label>\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n\n        <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe query will update immediately, so the input will display the new value. However, the deferredQuery will keep its previous value until the data has loaded, so SearchResults will show the stale results for a bit.\n\nTo make it more obvious to the user, you can add a visual indication when the stale result list is displayed:\n\n<div style={{\n\n  opacity: query !== deferredQuery ? 0.5 : 1 \n\n}}>\n\n  <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n\n</div>\n\nEnter \"a\" in the example below, wait for the results to load, and then edit the input to \"ab\". Notice how instead of the Suspense fallback, you now see the dimmed stale result list until the new results have loaded:\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n  const isStale = query !== deferredQuery;\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <div style={{ opacity: isStale ? 0.5 : 1 }}>\n          <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n        </div>\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nBoth deferred values and Transitions let you avoid showing Suspense fallback in favor of inline indicators. Transitions mark the whole update as non-urgent so they are typically used by frameworks and router libraries for navigation. Deferred values, on the other hand, are mostly useful in application code where you want to mark a part of UI as non-urgent and let it “lag behind” the rest of the UI.\n\nPreventing already revealed content from hiding \n\nWhen a component suspends, the closest parent Suspense boundary switches to showing the fallback. This can lead to a jarring user experience if it was already displaying some content. Try pressing this button:\n\nApp.js\nLayout.js\nIndexPage.js\nArtistPage.js\nAlbums.js\nBiography.js\nPanel.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState } from 'react';\nimport IndexPage from './IndexPage.js';\nimport ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js';\nimport Layout from './Layout.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n      <Router />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Router() {\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n    setPage(url);\n  }\n\n  let content;\n  if (page === '/') {\n    content = (\n      <IndexPage navigate={navigate} />\n    );\n  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {\n    content = (\n      <ArtistPage\n        artist={{\n          id: 'the-beatles',\n          name: 'The Beatles',\n        }}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      {content}\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen you pressed the button, the Router component rendered ArtistPage instead of IndexPage. A component inside ArtistPage suspended, so the closest Suspense boundary started showing the fallback. The closest Suspense boundary was near the root, so the whole site layout got replaced by BigSpinner.\n\nTo prevent this, you can mark the navigation state update as a Transition with startTransition:\n\nfunction Router() {\n\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n\n\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n\n    startTransition(() => {\n\n      setPage(url);      \n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nThis tells React that the state transition is not urgent, and it’s better to keep showing the previous page instead of hiding any already revealed content. Now clicking the button “waits” for the Biography to load:\n\nApp.js\nLayout.js\nIndexPage.js\nArtistPage.js\nAlbums.js\nBiography.js\nPanel.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, startTransition, useState } from 'react';\nimport IndexPage from './IndexPage.js';\nimport ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js';\nimport Layout from './Layout.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n      <Router />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Router() {\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setPage(url);\n    });\n  }\n\n  let content;\n  if (page === '/') {\n    content = (\n      <IndexPage navigate={navigate} />\n    );\n  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {\n    content = (\n      <ArtistPage\n        artist={{\n          id: 'the-beatles',\n          name: 'The Beatles',\n        }}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      {content}\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nA Transition doesn’t wait for all content to load. It only waits long enough to avoid hiding already revealed content. For example, the website Layout was already revealed, so it would be bad to hide it behind a loading spinner. However, the nested Suspense boundary around Albums is new, so the Transition doesn’t wait for it.\n\nNote\n\nSuspense-enabled routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into Transitions by default.\n\nIndicating that a Transition is happening \n\nIn the above example, once you click the button, there is no visual indication that a navigation is in progress. To add an indicator, you can replace startTransition with useTransition which gives you a boolean isPending value. In the example below, it’s used to change the website header styling while a Transition is happening:\n\nApp.js\nLayout.js\nIndexPage.js\nArtistPage.js\nAlbums.js\nBiography.js\nPanel.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useTransition } from 'react';\nimport IndexPage from './IndexPage.js';\nimport ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js';\nimport Layout from './Layout.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n      <Router />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Router() {\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setPage(url);\n    });\n  }\n\n  let content;\n  if (page === '/') {\n    content = (\n      <IndexPage navigate={navigate} />\n    );\n  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {\n    content = (\n      <ArtistPage\n        artist={{\n          id: 'the-beatles',\n          name: 'The Beatles',\n        }}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <Layout isPending={isPending}>\n      {content}\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nResetting Suspense boundaries on navigation \n\nDuring a Transition, React will avoid hiding already revealed content. However, if you navigate to a route with different parameters, you might want to tell React it is different content. You can express this with a key:\n\n<ProfilePage key={queryParams.id} />\n\nImagine you’re navigating within a user’s profile page, and something suspends. If that update is wrapped in a Transition, it will not trigger the fallback for already visible content. That’s the expected behavior.\n\nHowever, now imagine you’re navigating between two different user profiles. In that case, it makes sense to show the fallback. For example, one user’s timeline is different content from another user’s timeline. By specifying a key, you ensure that React treats different users’ profiles as different components, and resets the Suspense boundaries during navigation. Suspense-integrated routers should do this automatically.\n\nProviding a fallback for server errors and client-only content \n\nIf you use one of the streaming server rendering APIs (or a framework that relies on them), React will also use your <Suspense> boundaries to handle errors on the server. If a component throws an error on the server, React will not abort the server render. Instead, it will find the closest <Suspense> component above it and include its fallback (such as a spinner) into the generated server HTML. The user will see a spinner at first.\n\nOn the client, React will attempt to render the same component again. If it errors on the client too, React will throw the error and display the closest Error Boundary. However, if it does not error on the client, React will not display the error to the user since the content was eventually displayed successfully.\n\nYou can use this to opt out some components from rendering on the server. To do this, throw an error in the server environment and then wrap them in a <Suspense> boundary to replace their HTML with fallbacks:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <Chat />\n\n</Suspense>\n\n\n\nfunction Chat() {\n\n  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {\n\n    throw Error('Chat should only render on the client.');\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThe server HTML will include the loading indicator. It will be replaced by the Chat component on the client.\n\nTroubleshooting \nHow do I prevent the UI from being replaced by a fallback during an update? \n\nReplacing visible UI with a fallback creates a jarring user experience. This can happen when an update causes a component to suspend, and the nearest Suspense boundary is already showing content to the user.\n\nTo prevent this from happening, mark the update as non-urgent using startTransition. During a Transition, React will wait until enough data has loaded to prevent an unwanted fallback from appearing:\n\nfunction handleNextPageClick() {\n\n  // If this update suspends, don't hide the already displayed content\n\n  startTransition(() => {\n\n    setCurrentPage(currentPage + 1);\n\n  });\n\n}\n\nThis will avoid hiding existing content. However, any newly rendered Suspense boundaries will still immediately display fallbacks to avoid blocking the UI and let the user see the content as it becomes available.\n\nReact will only prevent unwanted fallbacks during non-urgent updates. It will not delay a render if it’s the result of an urgent update. You must opt in with an API like startTransition or useDeferredValue.\n\nIf your router is integrated with Suspense, it should wrap its updates into startTransition automatically.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<StrictMode>\nNEXT\n<Activity>"

    "title": "<Activity> – React",
    "url": "https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity",
    "html": "API REFERENCE\nCOMPONENTS\n<Activity>\n\n<Activity> lets you hide and restore the UI and internal state of its children.\n\n<Activity mode={visibility}>\n\n  <Sidebar />\n\n</Activity>\nReference\n<Activity>\nUsage\nRestoring the state of hidden components\nRestoring the DOM of hidden components\nPre-rendering content that’s likely to become visible\nSpeeding up interactions during page load\nTroubleshooting\nMy hidden components have unwanted side effects\nMy hidden components have Effects that aren’t running\nReference \n<Activity> \n\nYou can use Activity to hide part of your application:\n\n<Activity mode={isShowingSidebar ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}>\n\n  <Sidebar />\n\n</Activity>\n\nWhen an Activity boundary is hidden, React will visually hide its children using the display: \"none\" CSS property. It will also destroy their Effects, cleaning up any active subscriptions.\n\nWhile hidden, children still re-render in response to new props, albeit at a lower priority than the rest of the content.\n\nWhen the boundary becomes visible again, React will reveal the children with their previous state restored, and re-create their Effects.\n\nIn this way, Activity can be thought of as a mechanism for rendering “background activity”. Rather than completely discarding content that’s likely to become visible again, you can use Activity to maintain and restore that content’s UI and internal state, while ensuring that your hidden content has no unwanted side effects.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nProps \nchildren: The UI you intend to show and hide.\nmode: A string value of either 'visible' or 'hidden'. If omitted, defaults to 'visible'.\nCaveats \nIf an Activity is rendered inside of a ViewTransition, and it becomes visible as a result of an update caused by startTransition, it will activate the ViewTransition’s enter animation. If it becomes hidden, it will activate its exit animation.\nAn Activity that just renders text will not render anything rather than rendering hidden text, because there’s no corresponding DOM element to apply visibility changes to. For example, <Activity mode=\"hidden\"><ComponentThatJustReturnsText /></Activity> will not produce any output in the DOM for const ComponentThatJustReturnsText = () => \"Hello, World!\".\nUsage \nRestoring the state of hidden components \n\nIn React, when you want to conditionally show or hide a component, you typically mount or unmount it based on that condition:\n\n{isShowingSidebar && (\n\n  <Sidebar />\n\n)}\n\nBut unmounting a component destroys its internal state, which is not always what you want.\n\nWhen you hide a component using an Activity boundary instead, React will “save” its state for later:\n\n<Activity mode={isShowingSidebar ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}>\n\n  <Sidebar />\n\n</Activity>\n\nThis makes it possible to hide and then later restore components in the state they were previously in.\n\nThe following example has a sidebar with an expandable section. You can press “Overview” to reveal the three subitems below it. The main app area also has a button that hides and shows the sidebar.\n\nTry expanding the Overview section, and then toggling the sidebar closed then open:\n\nApp.js\nSidebar.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport Sidebar from './Sidebar.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isShowingSidebar, setIsShowingSidebar] = useState(true);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {isShowingSidebar && (\n        <Sidebar />\n      )}\n\n      <main>\n        <button onClick={() => setIsShowingSidebar(!isShowingSidebar)}>\n          Toggle sidebar\n        </button>\n        <h1>Main content</h1>\n      </main>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe Overview section always starts out collapsed. Because we unmount the sidebar when isShowingSidebar flips to false, all its internal state is lost.\n\nThis is a perfect use case for Activity. We can preserve the internal state of our sidebar, even when visually hiding it.\n\nLet’s replace the conditional rendering of our sidebar with an Activity boundary:\n\n// Before\n\n{isShowingSidebar && (\n\n  <Sidebar />\n\n)}\n\n\n\n// After\n\n<Activity mode={isShowingSidebar ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>\n\n  <Sidebar />\n\n</Activity>\n\nand check out the new behavior:\n\nApp.js\nSidebar.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Activity, useState } from 'react';\n\nimport Sidebar from './Sidebar.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isShowingSidebar, setIsShowingSidebar] = useState(true);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Activity mode={isShowingSidebar ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>\n        <Sidebar />\n      </Activity>\n\n      <main>\n        <button onClick={() => setIsShowingSidebar(!isShowingSidebar)}>\n          Toggle sidebar\n        </button>\n        <h1>Main content</h1>\n      </main>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nOur sidebar’s internal state is now restored, without any changes to its implementation.\n\nRestoring the DOM of hidden components \n\nSince Activity boundaries hide their children using display: none, their children’s DOM is also preserved when hidden. This makes them great for maintaining ephemeral state in parts of the UI that the user is likely to interact with again.\n\nIn this example, the Contact tab has a <textarea> where the user can enter a message. If you enter some text, change to the Home tab, then change back to the Contact tab, the draft message is lost:\n\nApp.js\nTabButton.js\nHome.js\nContact.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function Contact() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Send me a message!</p>\n\n      <textarea />\n\n      <p>You can find me online here:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>admin@mysite.com</li>\n        <li>+123456789</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThis is because we’re fully unmounting Contact in App. When the Contact tab unmounts, the <textarea> element’s internal DOM state is lost.\n\nIf we switch to using an Activity boundary to show and hide the active tab, we can preserve the state of each tab’s DOM.

If you press it, you’ll see a Suspense fallback displayed while the data is being fetched:\n\nApp.js\nHome.js\nPosts.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, Suspense } from 'react';\nimport TabButton from './TabButton.js';\nimport Home from './Home.js';\nimport Posts from './Posts.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('home');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'home'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}\n      >\n        Home\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'posts'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('posts')}\n      >\n        Posts\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<h1>🌀 Loading...</h1>}>\n        {activeTab === 'home' && <Home />}\n        {activeTab === 'posts' && <Posts />}\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis is because App doesn’t mount Posts until its tab is active.\n\nIf we update App to use an Activity boundary to show and hide the active tab, Posts will be pre-rendered when the app first loads, allowing it to fetch its data before it becomes visible.\n\nTry clicking the Posts tab now:\n\nApp.js\nHome.js\nPosts.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Activity, useState, Suspense } from 'react';\nimport TabButton from './TabButton.js';\nimport Home from './Home.js';\nimport Posts from './Posts.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('home');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'home'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}\n      >\n        Home\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'posts'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('posts')}\n      >\n        Posts\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<h1>🌀 Loading...</h1>}>\n        <Activity mode={activeTab === 'home' ?

They include:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a cached Promise with use\n\nActivity does not detect data that is fetched inside an Effect.\n\nThe exact way you would load data in the Posts component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.\n\nSuspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.\n\nSpeeding up interactions during page load \n\nReact includes an under-the-hood performance optimization called Selective Hydration. It works by hydrating your app’s initial HTML in chunks, enabling some components to become interactive even if other components on the page haven’t loaded their code or data yet.\n\nSuspense boundaries participate in Selective Hydration, because they naturally divide your component tree into units that are independent from one another:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MessageComposer />\n\n\n\n      <Suspense fallback=\"Loading chats...\">\n\n        <Chats />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </>\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nHere, MessageComposer can be fully hydrated during the initial render of the page, even before Chats is mounted and starts to fetch its data.\n\nSo by breaking up your component tree into discrete units, Suspense allows React to hydrate your app’s server-rendered HTML in chunks, enabling parts of your app to become interactive as fast as possible.\n\nBut what about pages that don’t use Suspense?\n\nTake this tabs example:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('home');\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <TabButton onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}>\n\n        Home\n\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <TabButton onClick={() => setActiveTab('video')}>\n\n        Video\n\n      </TabButton>\n\n\n\n      {activeTab === 'home' && (\n\n        <Home />\n\n      )}\n\n      {activeTab === 'video' && (\n\n        <Video />\n\n      )}\n\n    </>\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nHere, React must hydrate the entire page all at once. If Home or Video are slower to render, they could make the tab buttons feel unresponsive during hydration.\n\nAdding Suspense around the active tab would solve this:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('home');\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <TabButton onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}>\n\n        Home\n\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <TabButton onClick={() => setActiveTab('video')}>\n\n        Video\n\n      </TabButton>\n\n\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<Placeholder />}>\n\n        {activeTab === 'home' && (\n\n          <Home />\n\n        )}\n\n        {activeTab === 'video' && (\n\n          <Video />\n\n        )}\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </>\n\n  )\n\n}\n\n…but it would also change the UI, since the Placeholder fallback would be displayed on the initial render.\n\nInstead, we can use Activity. Since Activity boundaries show and hide their children, they already naturally divide the component tree into independent units. And just like Suspense, this feature allows them to participate in Selective Hydration.\n\nLet’s update our example to use Activity boundaries around the active tab:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('home');\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <TabButton onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}>\n\n        Home\n\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <TabButton onClick={() => setActiveTab('video')}>\n\n        Video\n\n      </TabButton>\n\n\n\n      <Activity mode={activeTab === \"home\" ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}>\n\n        <Home />\n\n      </Activity>\n\n      <Activity mode={activeTab === \"video\" ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}>\n\n        <Video />\n\n      </Activity>\n\n    </>\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nNow our initial server-rendered HTML looks the same as it did in the original version, but thanks to Activity, React can hydrate the tab buttons first, before it even mounts Home or Video.\n\nThus, in addition to hiding and showing content, Activity boundaries help improve your app’s performance during hydration by letting React know which parts of your page can become interactive in isolation.\n\nAnd even if your page doesn’t ever hide part of its content, you can still add always-visible Activity boundaries to improve hydration performance:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <Post />\n\n\n\n      <Activity>\n\n        <Comments />\n\n      </Activity>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nTroubleshooting \nMy hidden components have unwanted side effects \n\nAn Activity boundary hides its content by setting display: none on its children and cleaning up any of their Effects. So, most well-behaved React components that properly clean up their side effects will already be robust to being hidden by Activity.\n\nBut there are some situations where a hidden component behaves differently than an unmounted one. Most notably, since a hidden component’s DOM is not destroyed, any side effects from that DOM will persist, even after the component is hidden.\n\nAs an example, consider a <video> tag. Typically it doesn’t require any cleanup, because even if you’re playing a video, unmounting the tag stops the video and audio from playing in the browser. Try playing the video and then pressing Home in this demo:\n\nApp.js\nHome.js\nVideo.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport TabButton from './TabButton.js';\nimport Home from './Home.js';\nimport Video from './Video.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('video');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'home'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}\n      >\n        Home\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'video'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('video')}\n      >\n        Video\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      {activeTab === 'home' && <Home />}\n      {activeTab === 'video' && <Video />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe video stops playing as expected.\n\nNow, let’s say we wanted to preserve the timecode where the user last watched, so that when they tab back to the video, it doesn’t start over from the beginning again.\n\nThis is a great use case for Activity!\n\nLet’s update App to hide the inactive tab with a hidden Activity boundary instead of unmounting it, and see how the demo behaves this time:\n\nApp.js\nHome.js\nVideo.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Activity, useState } from 'react';\nimport TabButton from './TabButton.js';\nimport Home from './Home.js';\nimport Video from './Video.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('video');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'home'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}\n      >\n        Home\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'video'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('video')}\n      >\n        Video\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'home' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>\n        <Home />\n      </Activity>\n      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'video' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>\n        <Video />\n      </Activity>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhoops! The video and audio continue to play even after it’s been hidden, because the tab’s <video> element is still in the DOM.\n\nTo fix this, we can add an Effect with a cleanup function that pauses the video:\n\nexport default function VideoTab() {\n\n  const ref = useRef();\n\n\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n\n    const videoRef = ref.current;\n\n\n\n    return () => {\n\n      videoRef.pause()\n\n    }\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <video\n\n      ref={ref}\n\n      controls\n\n      playsInline\n\n      src=\"...\"\n\n    />\n\n\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nWe call useLayoutEffect instead of useEffect because conceptually the clean-up code is tied to the component’s UI being visually hidden. If we used a regular effect, the code could be delayed by (say) a re-suspending Suspense boundary or a View Transition.\n\nLet’s see the new behavior. Try playing the video, switching to the Home tab, then back to the Video tab:\n\nApp.js\nHome.js\nVideo.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Activity, useState } from 'react';\nimport TabButton from './TabButton.js';\nimport Home from './Home.js';\nimport Video from './Video.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('video');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'home'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}\n      >\n        Home\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'video'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('video')}\n      >\n        Video\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'home' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>\n        <Home />\n      </Activity>\n      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'video' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>\n        <Video />\n      </Activity>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIt works great! Our cleanup function ensures that the video stops playing if it’s ever hidden by an Activity boundary, and even better, because the <video> tag is never destroyed, the timecode is preserved, and the video itself doesn’t need to be initialized or downloaded again when the user switches back to keep watching it.\n\nThis is a great example of using Activity to preserve ephemeral DOM state for parts of the UI that become hidden, but the user is likely to interact with again soon.\n\nOur example illustrates that for certain tags like <video>, unmounting and hiding have different behavior. If a component renders DOM that has a side effect, and you want to prevent that side effect when an Activity boundary hides it, add an Effect with a return function to clean it up.\n\nThe most common cases of this will be from the following tags:\n\n<video>\n<audio>\n<iframe>\n\nTypically, though, most of your React components should already be robust to being hidden by an Activity boundary. And conceptually, you should think of “hidden” Activities as being unmounted.\n\nTo eagerly discover other Effects that don’t have proper cleanup, which is important not only for Activity boundaries but for many other behaviors in React, we recommend using <StrictMode>.\n\nMy hidden components have Effects that aren’t running \n\nWhen an <Activity> is “hidden”, all its children’s Effects are cleaned up. Conceptually, the children are unmounted, but React saves their state for later. This is a feature of Activity because it means subscriptions won’t be active for hidden parts of the UI, reducing the amount of work needed for hidden content.\n\nIf you’re relying on an Effect mounting to clean up a component’s side effects, refactor the Effect to do the work in the returned cleanup function instead.\n\nTo eagerly find problematic Effects, we recommend adding <StrictMode> which will eagerly perform Activity unmounts and mounts to catch any unexpected side-effects.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<Suspense>\nNEXT\n<ViewTransition>"

React uses the following heuristics to determine if a View Transition activates for an animation:\n\nenter: If a ViewTransition itself gets inserted in this Transition, then this will activate.\nexit: If a ViewTransition itself gets deleted in this Transition, then this will activate.\nupdate: If a ViewTransition has any DOM mutations inside it that React is doing (such as a prop changing) or if the ViewTransition boundary itself changes size or position due to an immediate sibling. If there are nested ViewTransition then the mutation applies to them and not the parent.\nshare: If a named ViewTransition is inside a deleted subtree and another named ViewTransition with the same name is part of an inserted subtree in the same Transition, they form a Shared Element Transition, and it animates from the deleted one to the inserted one.\n\nBy default, <ViewTransition> animates with a smooth cross-fade (the browser default view transition). You can customize the animation by providing a View Transition Class to the <ViewTransition> component. You can  customize animations for each kind of trigger (see Styling View Transitions).\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow does <ViewTransition> work? \nShow Details\nProps \n\nBy default, <ViewTransition> animates with a smooth cross-fade. You can customize the animation, or specify a shared element transition, with these props:\n\noptional enter: A string or object. The View Transition Class to apply when enter is activated.\noptional exit: A string or object. The View Transition Class to apply when exit is activated.\noptional update: A string or object. The View Transition Class to apply when an update is activated.\noptional share: A string or object. The View Transition Class to apply when a shared element is activated.\noptional default: A string or object. The View Transition Class used when no other matching activation prop is found.\noptional name: A string or object. The name of the View Transition used for shared element transitions. If not provided, React will use a unique name for each View Transition to prevent unexpected animations.\nCallback \n\nThese callbacks allow you to adjust the animation imperatively using the animate APIs:\n\noptional onEnter: A function. React calls onEnter after an “enter” animation.\noptional onExit: A function. React calls onExit after an “exit” animation.\noptional onShare: A function. React calls onShare after a “share” animation.\noptional onUpdate: A function. React calls onUpdate after an “update” animation.\n\nEach callback receives as arguments:\n\nelement: The DOM element that was animated.\ntypes: The Transition Types included in the animation.\nView Transition Class \n\nThe View Transition Class is the CSS class name(s) applied by React during the transition when the ViewTransition activates. It can be a string or an object.\n\nstring: the class added on the child elements when activated. If 'none' is provided, no class will be added.\nobject: the class added on the child elements will be the key matching View Transition type added with addTransitionType. The object can also specify a default to use if no matching type is found.\n\nThe value 'none' can be used to prevent a View Transition from activating for a specific trigger.\n\nStyling View Transitions \nNote\n\nIn many early examples of View Transitions around the web, you’ll have seen using a view-transition-name and then style it using ::view-transition-...(my-name) selectors. We don’t recommend that for styling. Instead, we normally recommend using a View Transition Class instead.\n\nTo customize the animation for a <ViewTransition> you can provide a View Transition Class to one of the activation props. The View Transition Class is a CSS class name that React applies to the child elements when the ViewTransition activates.\n\nFor example, to customize an “enter” animation, provide a class name to the enter prop:\n\n<ViewTransition enter=\"slide-in\">\n\nWhen the <ViewTransition> activates an “enter” animation, React will add the class name slide-in. Then you can refer to this class using view transition pseudo selectors to build reusable animations:\n\n::view-transition-group(.slide-in) {\n\n  \n\n}\n\n::view-transition-old(.slide-in) {\n\n\n\n}\n\n::view-transition-new(.slide-in) {\n\n\n\n}\n\nIn the future, CSS libraries may add built-in animations using View Transition Classes to make this easier to use.\n\nCaveats \nBy default, setState updates immediately and does not activate <ViewTransition>, only updates wrapped in a Transition. You can also use <Suspense> to opt-in to a Transition to reveal content.\n<ViewTransition> creates an image that can be moved around, scaled and cross-faded. Unlike Layout Animations you may have seen in React Native or Motion, this means that not every individual Element inside of it animates its position. This can lead to better performance and a more continuous feeling, smooth animation compared to animating every individual piece. However, it can also lose continuity in things that should be moving by themselves. So you might have to add more <ViewTransition> boundaries manually as a result.\nMany users may prefer not having animations on the page. React doesn’t automatically disable animations for this case. We recommend that using the @media (prefers-reduced-motion) media query to disable animations or tone them down based on user preference. In the future, CSS libraries may have this built-in to their presets.\nCurrently, <ViewTransition> only works in the DOM. We’re working on adding support for React Native and other platforms.\nUsage \nAnimating an element on enter/exit \n\nEnter/Exit Transitions trigger when a <ViewTransition> is added or removed by a component in a transition:\n\nfunction Child() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ViewTransition>\n\n      <div>Hi</div>\n\n    </ViewTransition>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Parent() {\n\n  const [show, setShow] = useState();\n\n  if (show) {\n\n    return <Child />;\n\n  }\n\n  return null;\n\n}\n\nWhen setShow is called, show switches to true and the Child component is rendered. When setShow is called inside startTransition, and Child renders a ViewTransition before any other DOM nodes, an enter animation is triggered.\n\nWhen show switches back to false, an exit animation is triggered.\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition\n} from 'react';\nimport {Video} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\"\n\nfunction Item() {\n  return (\n    <ViewTransition>\n      <Video video={videos[0]}/>\n    </ViewTransition>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [showItem, setShowItem] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          startTransition(() => {\n            setShowItem((prev) => !prev);\n          });\n        }}\n      >{showItem ? '➖' : '➕'}</button>\n\n      {showItem ? <Item /> : null}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\n<ViewTransition> only activates if it is placed before any DOM node. If Child instead looked like this, no animation would trigger:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return <ViewTransition>Hi</ViewTransition>;\n\n}\nAnimating a shared element \n\nNormally, we don’t recommend assigning a name to a <ViewTransition> and instead let React assign it an automatic name. The reason you might want to assign a name is to animate between completely different components when one tree unmounts and another tree mounts at the same time. To preserve continuity.\n\n<ViewTransition name={UNIQUE_NAME}>\n\n  <Child />\n\n</ViewTransition>\n\nWhen one tree unmounts and another mounts, if there’s a pair where the same name exists in the unmounting tree and the mounting tree, they trigger the “share” animation on both. It animates from the unmounting side to the mounting side.\n\nUnlike an exit/enter animation this can be deeply inside the deleted/mounted tree. If a <ViewTransition> would also be eligible for exit/enter, then the “share” animation takes precedence.\n\nIf Transition first unmounts one side and then leads to a <Suspense> fallback being shown before eventually the new name being mounted, then no shared element transition happens.\n\nApp.js\nVideo.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition\n} from \"react\";\nimport {Video, Thumbnail, FullscreenVideo} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\";\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [fullscreen, setFullscreen] = useState(false);\n  if (fullscreen) {\n    return <FullscreenVideo\n      video={videos[0]}\n      onExit={() => startTransition(() => setFullscreen(false))}\n    />\n  }\n  return <Video\n    video={videos[0]}\n    onClick={() => startTransition(() => setFullscreen(true))}\n  />\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nIf either the mounted or unmounted side of a pair is outside the viewport, then no pair is formed. This ensures that it doesn’t fly in or out of the viewport when something is scrolled. Instead it’s treated as a regular enter/exit by itself.\n\nThis does not happen if the same Component instance changes position, which triggers an “update”. Those animate regardless if one position is outside the viewport.\n\nThere’s currently a quirk where if a deeply nested unmounted <ViewTransition> is inside the viewport but the mounted side is not within the viewport, then the unmounted side animates as its own “exit” animation even if it’s deeply nested instead of as part of the parent animation.\n\nPitfall\n\nIt’s important that there’s only one thing with the same name mounted at a time in the entire app. Therefore it’s important to use unique namespaces for the name to avoid conflicts. To ensure you can do this you might want to add a constant in a separate module that you import.\n\nexport const MY_NAME = \"my-globally-unique-name\";\n\nimport {MY_NAME} from './shared-name';\n\n...\n\n<ViewTransition name={MY_NAME}>\nAnimating reorder of items in a list \nitems.map(item => <Component key={item.id} item={item} />)\n\nWhen reordering a list, without updating the content, the “update” animation triggers on each <ViewTransition> in the list if they’re outside a DOM node. Similar to enter/exit animations.\n\nThis means that this will trigger the animation on this <ViewTransition>:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return <ViewTransition><div>...</div></ViewTransition>;\n\n}\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition\n} from \"react\";\nimport {Video} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\";\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [orderedVideos, setOrderedVideos] = useState(videos);\n  const reorder = () => {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setOrderedVideos((prev) => {\n        return [...prev.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)];\n      });\n    });\n  };\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={reorder}>🎲</button>\n      <div className=\"listContainer\">\n        {orderedVideos.map((video, i) => {\n          return (\n            <ViewTransition key={video.title}>\n              <Video video={video} />\n            </ViewTransition>\n          );\n        })}\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHowever, this wouldn’t animate each individual item:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return <div><ViewTransition>...</ViewTransition></div>;\n\n}\n\nInstead, any parent <ViewTransition> would cross-fade. If there is no parent <ViewTransition> then there’s no animation in that case.\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition\n} from \"react\";\nimport {Video} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\";\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [orderedVideos, setOrderedVideos] = useState(videos);\n  const reorder = () => {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setOrderedVideos((prev) => {\n        return [...prev.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)];\n      });\n    });\n  };\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={reorder}>🎲</button>\n      <ViewTransition>\n        <div className=\"listContainer\">\n          {orderedVideos.map((video, i) => {\n            return <Video video={video} key={video.title} />;\n          })}\n        </div>\n      </ViewTransition>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis means you might want to avoid wrapper elements in lists where you want to allow the Component to control its own reorder animation:\n\nitems.map(item => <div><Component key={item.id} item={item} /></div>)\n\nThe above rule also applies if one of the items updates to resize, which then causes the siblings to resize, it’ll also animate its sibling <ViewTransition> but only if they’re immediate siblings.\n\nThis means that during an update, which causes a lot of re-layout, it doesn’t individually animate every <ViewTransition> on the page. That would lead to a lot of noisy animations which distracts from the actual change. Therefore React is more conservative about when an individual animation triggers.\n\nPitfall\n\nIt’s important to properly use keys to preserve identity when reordering lists. It might seem like you could use “name”, shared element transitions, to animate reorders but that would not trigger if one side was outside the viewport. To animate a reorder you often want to show that it went to a position outside the viewport.\n\nAnimating from Suspense content \n\nJust like any Transition, React waits for data and new CSS (<link rel=\"stylesheet\" precedence=\"...\">) before running the animation. In addition to this, ViewTransitions also wait up to 500ms for new fonts to load before starting the animation to avoid them flickering in later. For the same reason, an image wrapped in ViewTransition will wait for the image to load.\n\nIf it’s inside a new Suspense boundary instance, then the fallback is shown first. After the Suspense boundary fully loads, it triggers the <ViewTransition> to animate the reveal to the content.\n\nCurrently, this only happens for client-side Transition. In the future, this will also animate Suspense boundary for streaming SSR when content from the server suspends during the initial load.\n\nThere are two ways to animate Suspense boundaries depending on where you place the <ViewTransition>:\n\nUpdate:\n\n<ViewTransition>\n\n  <Suspense fallback={<A />}>\n\n    <B />\n\n  </Suspense>\n\n</ViewTransition>\n\nIn this scenario when the content goes from A to B, it’ll be treated as an “update” and apply that class if appropriate. Both A and B will get the same view-transition-name and therefore they’re acting as a cross-fade by default.\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition,\n  Suspense\n} from 'react';\nimport {Video, VideoPlaceholder} from \"./Video\";\nimport {useLazyVideoData} from \"./data\"\n\nfunction LazyVideo() {\n  const video = useLazyVideoData();\n  return (\n    <Video video={video}/>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [showItem, setShowItem] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          startTransition(() => {\n            setShowItem((prev) => !prev);\n          });\n        }}\n      >{showItem ?

This will be treated as an “exit” of the <A> and an “enter” of the <B>.\n\nYou can achieve different effects depending on where you choose to place the <ViewTransition> boundary.\n\nOpting-out of an animation \n\nSometimes you’re wrapping a large existing component, like a whole page, and you want to animate some updates, such as changing the theme. However, you don’t want it to opt-in all updates inside the whole page to cross-fade when they’re updating. Especially if you’re incrementally adding more animations.\n\nYou can use the class “none” to opt-out of an animation. By wrapping your children in a “none” you can disable animations for updates to them while the parent still triggers.\n\n<ViewTransition>\n\n  <div className={theme}>\n\n    <ViewTransition update=\"none\">\n\n      {children}\n\n    </ViewTransition>\n\n  </div>\n\n</ViewTransition>\n\nThis will only animate if the theme changes and not if only the children update. The children can still opt-in again with their own <ViewTransition> but at least it’s manual again.\n\nCustomizing animations \n\nBy default, <ViewTransition> includes the default cross-fade from the browser.\n\nTo customize animations, you can provide props to the <ViewTransition> component to specify which animations to use, based on how the <ViewTransition> activates.\n\nFor example, we can slow down the default cross fade animation:\n\n<ViewTransition default=\"slow-fade\">\n\n  <Video />\n\n</ViewTransition>\n\nAnd define slow-fade in CSS using view transition classes:\n\n::view-transition-old(.slow-fade) {\n\n    animation-duration: 500ms;\n\n}\n\n\n\n::view-transition-new(.slow-fade) {\n\n    animation-duration: 500ms;\n\n}\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition\n} from 'react';\nimport {Video} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\"\n\nfunction Item() {\n  return (\n    <ViewTransition default=\"slow-fade\">\n      <Video video={videos[0]}/>\n    </ViewTransition>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [showItem, setShowItem] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          startTransition(() => {\n            setShowItem((prev) => !prev);\n          });\n        }}\n      >{showItem ? '➖' : '➕'}</button>\n\n      {showItem ? <Item /> : null}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn addition to setting the default, you can also provide configurations for enter, exit, update, and share animations.\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition\n} from 'react';\nimport {Video} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\"\n\nfunction Item() {\n  return (\n    <ViewTransition enter=\"slide-in\" exit=\"slide-out\">\n      <Video video={videos[0]}/>\n    </ViewTransition>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [showItem, setShowItem] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          startTransition(() => {\n            setShowItem((prev) => !prev);\n          });\n        }}\n      >{showItem ? '➖' : '➕'}</button>\n\n      {showItem ? <Item /> : null}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nCustomizing animations with types \n\nYou can use the addTransitionType API to add a class name to the child elements when a specific transition type is activated for a specific activation trigger. This allows you to customize the animation for each type of transition.\n\nFor example, to customize the animation for all forward and backward navigations:\n\n<ViewTransition default={{\n\n  'navigation-back': 'slide-right',\n\n  'navigation-forward': 'slide-left',\n\n }}>\n\n  <div>...</div>\n\n</ViewTransition>\n\n \n\n// in your router:\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  addTransitionType('navigation-' + navigationType);\n\n});\n\nWhen the ViewTransition activates a “navigation-back” animation, React will add the class name “slide-right”. When the ViewTransition activates a “navigation-forward” animation, React will add the class name “slide-left”.\n\nIn the future, routers and other libraries may add support for standard view-transition types and styles.\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  addTransitionType,\n  useState,\n  startTransition,\n} from \"react\";\nimport {Video} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\"\n\nfunction Item() {\n  return (\n    <ViewTransition enter={\n        {\n          \"add-video-back\": \"slide-in-back\",\n          \"add-video-forward\": \"slide-in-forward\"\n        }\n      }\n      exit={\n        {\n          \"remove-video-back\": \"slide-in-forward\",\n          \"remove-video-forward\": \"slide-in-back\"\n        }\n      }>\n      <Video video={videos[0]}/>\n    </ViewTransition>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [showItem, setShowItem] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"button-container\">\n        <button\n          onClick={() => {\n            startTransition(() => {\n              if (showItem) {\n                addTransitionType(\"remove-video-back\")\n              } else {\n                addTransitionType(\"add-video-back\")\n              }\n              setShowItem((prev) => !prev);\n            });\n          }}\n        >⬅️</button>\n        <button\n          onClick={() => {\n            startTransition(() => {\n              if (showItem) {\n                addTransitionType(\"remove-video-forward\")\n              } else {\n                addTransitionType(\"add-video-forward\")\n              }\n              setShowItem((prev) => !prev);\n            });\n          }}\n        >➡️</button>\n      </div>\n      {showItem ? <Item /> : null}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nBuilding View Transition enabled routers \n\nReact waits for any pending Navigation to finish to ensure that scroll restoration happens within the animation. If the Navigation is blocked on React, your router must unblock in useLayoutEffect since useEffect would lead to a deadlock.\n\nIf a startTransition is started from the legacy popstate event, such as during a “back”-navigation then it must finish synchronously to ensure scroll and form restoration works correctly. This is in conflict with running a View Transition animation. Therefore, React will skip animations from popstate. Therefore animations won’t run for the back button. You can fix this by upgrading your router to use the Navigation API.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy <ViewTransition> is not activating \n\n<ViewTransition> only activates if it is placed before any DOM node:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <div>\n\n      <ViewTransition>Hi</ViewTransition>\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nTo fix, ensure that the <ViewTransition> comes before any other DOM nodes:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ViewTransition>\n\n      <div>Hi</div>\n\n    </ViewTransition>\n\n  );\n\n}\nI’m getting an error “There are two <ViewTransition name=%s> components with the same name mounted at the same time.” \n\nThis error occurs when two <ViewTransition> components with the same name are mounted at the same time:\n\nfunction Item() {\n\n  // 🚩 All items will get the same \"name\".\n\n  return <ViewTransition name=\"item\">...</ViewTransition>;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction ItemList({items}) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      {item.map(item => <Item key={item.id} />)}\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis will cause the View Transition to error. In development, React detects this issue to surface it and logs two errors:\n\nConsole\nThere are two <ViewTransition name=%s> components with the same name mounted at the same time. This is not supported and will cause View Transitions to error. Try to use a more unique name e.g. by using a namespace prefix and adding the id of an item to the name.\n    at Item\n    at ItemList\nThe existing <ViewTransition name=%s> duplicate has this stack trace.\n    at Item\n    at ItemList\n\nTo fix, ensure that there’s only one <ViewTransition> with the same name mounted at a time in the entire app by ensuring the name is unique, or adding an id to the name:\n\nfunction Item({id}) {\n\n  // ✅ All items will get the same \"name\".\n\n  return <ViewTransition name={`item-${id}`}>...</ViewTransition>;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction ItemList({items}) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      {item.map(item => <Item key={item.id} item={item} />)}\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\n<Activity>\nNEXT\nAPIs"

    "html": "API REFERENCE\nAPIS\nact\n\nact is a test helper to apply pending React updates before making assertions.\n\nawait act(async actFn)\n\nTo prepare a component for assertions, wrap the code rendering it and performing updates inside an await act() call. This makes your test run closer to how React works in the browser.\n\nNote\n\nYou might find using act() directly a bit too verbose. To avoid some of the boilerplate, you could use a library like React Testing Library, whose helpers are wrapped with act().\n\nReference\nawait act(async actFn)\nUsage\nRendering components in tests\nDispatching events in tests\nTroubleshooting\nI’m getting an error: “The current testing environment is not configured to support act”(…)”\nReference \nawait act(async actFn) \n\nWhen writing UI tests, tasks like rendering, user events, or data fetching can be considered as “units” of interaction with a user interface. React provides a helper called act() that makes sure all updates related to these “units” have been processed and applied to the DOM before you make any assertions.\n\nThe name act comes from the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.\n\nit ('renders with button disabled', async () => {\n\n  await act(async () => {\n\n    root.render(<TestComponent />)\n\n  });\n\n  expect(container.querySelector('button')).toBeDisabled();\n\n});\nNote\n\nWe recommend using act with await and an async function. Although the sync version works in many cases, it doesn’t work in all cases and due to the way React schedules updates internally, it’s difficult to predict when you can use the sync version.\n\nWe will deprecate and remove the sync version in the future.\n\nParameters \nasync actFn: An async function wrapping renders or interactions for components being tested. Any updates triggered within the actFn, are added to an internal act queue, which are then flushed together to process and apply any changes to the DOM. Since it is async, React will also run any code that crosses an async boundary, and flush any updates scheduled.\nReturns \n\nact does not return anything.\n\nUsage \n\nWhen testing a component, you can use act to make assertions about its output.\n\nFor example, let’s say we have this Counter component, the usage examples below show how to test it:\n\nfunction Counter() {\n\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = () => {\n\n    setCount(prev => prev + 1);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;\n\n  }, [count]);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div>\n\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n\n        Click me\n\n      </button>\n\n    </div>\n\n  )\n\n}\nRendering components in tests \n\nTo test the render output of a component, wrap the render inside act():\n\nimport {act} from 'react';\n\nimport ReactDOMClient from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport Counter from './Counter';\n\n\n\nit('can render and update a counter', async () => {\n\n  container = document.createElement('div');\n\n  document.body.appendChild(container);\n\n  \n\n  // ✅ Render the component inside act().\n\n  await act(() => {\n\n    ReactDOMClient.createRoot(container).render(<Counter />);\n\n  });\n\n  \n\n  const button = container.querySelector('button');\n\n  const label = container.querySelector('p');\n\n  expect(label.textContent).toBe('You clicked 0 times');\n\n  expect(document.title).toBe('You clicked 0 times');\n\n});\n\nHere, we create a container, append it to the document, and render the Counter component inside act(). This ensures that the component is rendered and its effects are applied before making assertions.\n\nUsing act ensures that all updates have been applied before we make assertions.\n\nDispatching events in tests \n\nTo test events, wrap the event dispatch inside act():\n\nimport {act} from 'react';\n\nimport ReactDOMClient from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport Counter from './Counter';\n\n\n\nit.only('can render and update a counter', async () => {\n\n  const container = document.createElement('div');\n\n  document.body.appendChild(container);\n\n  \n\n  await act( async () => {\n\n    ReactDOMClient.createRoot(container).render(<Counter />);\n\n  });\n\n  \n\n  // ✅ Dispatch the event inside act().\n\n  await act(async () => {\n\n    button.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click', { bubbles: true }));\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  const button = container.querySelector('button');\n\n  const label = container.querySelector('p');\n\n  expect(label.textContent).toBe('You clicked 1 times');\n\n  expect(document.title).toBe('You clicked 1 times');\n\n});\n\nHere, we render the component with act, and then dispatch the event inside another act(). This ensures that all updates from the event are applied before making assertions.\n\nPitfall\n\nDon’t forget that dispatching DOM events only works when the DOM container is added to the document. You can use a library like React Testing Library to reduce the boilerplate code.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI’m getting an error: “The current testing environment is not configured to support act”(…)” \n\nUsing act requires setting global.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT=true in your test environment. This is to ensure that act is only used in the correct environment.\n\nIf you don’t set the global, you will see an error like this:\n\nConsole\nWarning: The current testing environment is not configured to support act(…)\n\nTo fix, add this to your global setup file for React tests:\n\nglobal.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT=true\nNote\n\nIn testing frameworks like React Testing Library, IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT is already set for you.\n\nPREVIOUS\nAPIs\nNEXT\naddTransitionType"

This means a <Suspense> fallback will associate the types after a startTransition, but revealing the content does not.\nUsage \nAdding the cause of a transition \n\nCall addTransitionType inside of startTransition to indicate the cause of a transition:\n\nimport { startTransition, addTransitionType } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Submit({action) {\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    startTransition(() => {\n\n      addTransitionType('submit-click');\n\n      action();\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;\n\n}\n\nWhen you call addTransitionType inside the scope of startTransition, React will associate submit-click as one of the causes for the Transition.\n\nCurrently, Transition Types can be used to customize different animations based on what caused the Transition. You have three different ways to choose from for how to use them:\n\nCustomize animations using browser view transition types\nCustomize animations using View Transition Class\nCustomize animations using ViewTransition events\n\nIn the future, we plan to support more use cases for using the cause of a transition.\n\nCustomize animations using browser view transition types \n\nWhen a ViewTransition activates from a transition, React adds all the Transition Types as browser view transition types to the element.\n\nThis allows you to customize different animations based on CSS scopes:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ViewTransition>\n\n      <div>Hello</div>\n\n    </ViewTransition>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  addTransitionType('my-transition-type');\n\n  setShow(true);\n\n});\n:root:active-view-transition-type(my-transition-type) {\n\n  &::view-transition-...(...) {\n\n    ...\n\n  }\n\n}\nCustomize animations using View Transition Class \n\nYou can customize animations for an activated ViewTransition based on type by passing an object to the View Transition Class:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ViewTransition enter={{\n\n      'my-transition-type': 'my-transition-class',\n\n    }}>\n\n      <div>Hello</div>\n\n    </ViewTransition>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\n// ...\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  addTransitionType('my-transition-type');\n\n  setState(newState);\n\n});\n\nIf multiple types match, then they’re joined together. If no types match then the special “default” entry is used instead. If any type has the value “none” then that wins and the ViewTransition is disabled (not assigned a name).\n\nThese can be combined with enter/exit/update/layout/share props to match based on kind of trigger and Transition Type.\n\n<ViewTransition enter={{\n\n  'navigation-back': 'enter-right',\n\n  'navigation-forward': 'enter-left',\n\n}}\n\nexit={{\n\n  'navigation-back': 'exit-right',\n\n  'navigation-forward': 'exit-left',\n\n}}>\nCustomize animations using ViewTransition events \n\nYou can imperatively customize animations for an activated ViewTransition based on type using View Transition events:\n\n<ViewTransition onUpdate={(inst, types) => {\n\n  if (types.includes('navigation-back')) {\n\n    ...\n\n  } else if (types.includes('navigation-forward')) {\n\n    ...\n\n  } else {\n\n    ...\n\n  }\n\n}}>\n\nThis allows you to pick different imperative Animations based on the cause.\n\nPREVIOUS\nact\nNEXT\ncache"

    "html": "API REFERENCE\nAPIS\ncache\nReact Server Components\n\ncache is only for use with React Server Components.\n\ncache lets you cache the result of a data fetch or computation.\n\nconst cachedFn = cache(fn);\nReference\ncache(fn)\nUsage\nCache an expensive computation\nShare a snapshot of data\nPreload data\nTroubleshooting\nMy memoized function still runs even though I’ve called it with the same arguments\nReference \ncache(fn) \n\nCall cache outside of any components to create a version of the function with caching.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport calculateMetrics from 'lib/metrics';\n\n\n\nconst getMetrics = cache(calculateMetrics);\n\n\n\nfunction Chart({data}) {\n\n  const report = getMetrics(data);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nWhen getMetrics is first called with data, getMetrics will call calculateMetrics(data) and store the result in cache. If getMetrics is called again with the same data, it will return the cached result instead of calling calculateMetrics(data) again.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \nfn: The function you want to cache results for. fn can take any arguments and return any value.\nReturns \n\ncache returns a cached version of fn with the same type signature. It does not call fn in the process.\n\nWhen calling cachedFn with given arguments, it first checks if a cached result exists in the cache. If a cached result exists, it returns the result. If not, it calls fn with the arguments, stores the result in the cache, and returns the result. The only time fn is called is when there is a cache miss.\n\nNote\n\nThe optimization of caching return values based on inputs is known as memoization. We refer to the function returned from cache as a memoized function.\n\nCaveats \nReact will invalidate the cache for all memoized functions for each server request.\nEach call to cache creates a new function. This means that calling cache with the same function multiple times will return different memoized functions that do not share the same cache.\ncachedFn will also cache errors. If fn throws an error for certain arguments, it will be cached, and the same error is re-thrown when cachedFn is called with those same arguments.\ncache is for use in Server Components only.\nUsage \nCache an expensive computation \n\nUse cache to skip duplicate work.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport calculateUserMetrics from 'lib/user';\n\n\n\nconst getUserMetrics = cache(calculateUserMetrics);\n\n\n\nfunction Profile({user}) {\n\n  const metrics = getUserMetrics(user);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction TeamReport({users}) {\n\n  for (let user in users) {\n\n    const metrics = getUserMetrics(user);\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIf the same user object is rendered in both Profile and TeamReport, the two components can share work and only call calculateUserMetrics once for that user.\n\nAssume Profile is rendered first. It will call getUserMetrics, and check if there is a cached result. Since it is the first time getUserMetrics is called with that user, there will be a cache miss. getUserMetrics will then call calculateUserMetrics with that user and write the result to cache.\n\nWhen TeamReport renders its list of users and reaches the same user object, it will call getUserMetrics and read the result from cache.\n\nIf calculateUserMetrics can be aborted by passing an AbortSignal, you can use cacheSignal() to cancel the expensive computation if React has finished rendering. calculateUserMetrics may already handle cancellation internally by using cacheSignal directly.\n\nPitfall\nCalling different memoized functions will read from different caches. \n\nTo access the same cache, components must call the same memoized function.\n\n// Temperature.js\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport {calculateWeekReport} from './report';\n\n\n\nexport function Temperature({cityData}) {\n\n  // 🚩 Wrong: Calling `cache` in component creates new `getWeekReport` for each render\n\n  const getWeekReport = cache(calculateWeekReport);\n\n  const report = getWeekReport(cityData);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n// Precipitation.js\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport {calculateWeekReport} from './report';\n\n\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: `getWeekReport` is only accessible for `Precipitation` component.\n\nconst getWeekReport = cache(calculateWeekReport);\n\n\n\nexport function Precipitation({cityData}) {\n\n  const report = getWeekReport(cityData);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIn the above example, Precipitation and Temperature each call cache to create a new memoized function with their own cache look-up. If both components render for the same cityData, they will do duplicate work to call calculateWeekReport.\n\nIn addition, Temperature creates a new memoized function each time the component is rendered which doesn’t allow for any cache sharing.\n\nTo maximize cache hits and reduce work, the two components should call the same memoized function to access the same cache. Instead, define the memoized function in a dedicated module that can be import-ed across components.\n\n// getWeekReport.js\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport {calculateWeekReport} from './report';\n\n\n\nexport default cache(calculateWeekReport);\n// Temperature.js\n\nimport getWeekReport from './getWeekReport';\n\n\n\nexport default function Temperature({cityData}) {\n\n\tconst report = getWeekReport(cityData);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n// Precipitation.js\n\nimport getWeekReport from './getWeekReport';\n\n\n\nexport default function Precipitation({cityData}) {\n\n  const report = getWeekReport(cityData);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nHere, both components call the same memoized function exported from ./getWeekReport.js to read and write to the same cache.\n\nShare a snapshot of data \n\nTo share a snapshot of data between components, call cache with a data-fetching function like fetch. When multiple components make the same data fetch, only one request is made and the data returned is cached and shared across components. All components refer to the same snapshot of data across the server render.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport {fetchTemperature} from './api.js';\n\n\n\nconst getTemperature = cache(async (city) => {\n\n\treturn await fetchTemperature(city);\n\n});\n\n\n\nasync function AnimatedWeatherCard({city}) {\n\n\tconst temperature = await getTemperature(city);\n\n\t// ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nasync function MinimalWeatherCard({city}) {\n\n\tconst temperature = await getTemperature(city);\n\n\t// ...\n\n}\n\nIf AnimatedWeatherCard and MinimalWeatherCard both render for the same city, they will receive the same snapshot of data from the memoized function.\n\nIf AnimatedWeatherCard and MinimalWeatherCard supply different city arguments to getTemperature, then fetchTemperature will be called twice and each call site will receive different data.\n\nThe city acts as a cache key.\n\nNote\n\nAsynchronous rendering is only supported for Server Components.\n\nasync function AnimatedWeatherCard({city}) {\n\n\tconst temperature = await getTemperature(city);\n\n\t// ...\n\n}\n\nTo render components that use asynchronous data in Client Components, see use() documentation.\n\nPreload data \n\nBy caching a long-running data fetch, you can kick off asynchronous work prior to rendering the component.\n\nconst getUser = cache(async (id) => {\n\n  return await db.user.query(id);\n\n});\n\n\n\nasync function Profile({id}) {\n\n  const user = await getUser(id);\n\n  return (\n\n    <section>\n\n      <img src={user.profilePic} />\n\n      <h2>{user.name}</h2>\n\n    </section>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Page({id}) {\n\n  // ✅ Good: start fetching the user data\n\n  getUser(id);\n\n  // ... some computational work\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <Profile id={id} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nWhen rendering Page, the component calls getUser but note that it doesn’t use the returned data. This early getUser call kicks off the asynchronous database query that occurs while Page is doing other computational work and rendering children.\n\nWhen rendering Profile, we call getUser again. If the initial getUser call has already returned and cached the user data, when Profile asks and waits for this data, it can simply read from the cache without requiring another remote procedure call. If the  initial data request hasn’t been completed, preloading data in this pattern reduces delay in data-fetching.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nCaching asynchronous work \nShow Details\nPitfall\nCalling a memoized function outside of a component will not use the cache. \nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst getUser = cache(async (userId) => {\n\n  return await db.user.query(userId);\n\n});\n\n\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: Calling memoized function outside of component will not memoize.\n\ngetUser('demo-id');\n\n\n\nasync function DemoProfile() {\n\n  // ✅ Good: `getUser` will memoize.\n\n  const user = await getUser('demo-id');\n\n  return <Profile user={user} />;\n\n}\n\nReact only provides cache access to the memoized function in a component. When calling getUser outside of a component, it will still evaluate the function but not read or update the cache.\n\nThis is because cache access is provided through a context which is only accessible from a component.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhen should I use cache, memo, or useMemo? \nShow Details\nTroubleshooting \nMy memoized function still runs even though I’ve called it with the same arguments \n\nSee prior mentioned pitfalls\n\nCalling different memoized functions will read from different caches.\nCalling a memoized function outside of a component will not use the cache.\n\nIf none of the above apply, it may be a problem with how React checks if something exists in cache.\n\nIf your arguments are not primitives (ex. objects, functions, arrays), ensure you’re passing the same object reference.\n\nWhen calling a memoized function, React will look up the input arguments to see if a result is already cached. React will use shallow equality of the arguments to determine if there is a cache hit.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst calculateNorm = cache((vector) => {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\n\n\nfunction MapMarker(props) {\n\n  // 🚩 Wrong: props is an object that changes every render.\n\n  const length = calculateNorm(props);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />\n\n      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn this case the two MapMarkers look like they’re doing the same work and calling calculateNorm with the same value of {x: 10, y: 10, z:10}. Even though the objects contain the same values, they are not the same object reference as each component creates its own props object.\n\nReact will call Object.is on the input to verify if there is a cache hit.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst calculateNorm = cache((x, y, z) => {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\n\n\nfunction MapMarker(props) {\n\n  // ✅ Good: Pass primitives to memoized function\n\n  const length = calculateNorm(props.x, props.y, props.z);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />\n\n      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nOne way to address this could be to pass the vector dimensions to calculateNorm. This works because the dimensions themselves are primitives.\n\nAnother solution may be to pass the vector object itself as a prop to the component. We’ll need to pass the same object to both component instances.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst calculateNorm = cache((vector) => {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\n\n\nfunction MapMarker(props) {\n\n  // ✅ Good: Pass the same `vector` object\n\n  const length = calculateNorm(props.vector);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const vector = [10, 10, 10];\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MapMarker vector={vector} />\n\n      <MapMarker vector={vector} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\naddTransitionType\nNEXT\ncacheSignal"

If you don’t have any meaningful default value, specify null. The default value is meant as a “last resort” fallback. It is static and never changes over time.\nReturns \n\ncreateContext returns a context object.\n\nThe context object itself does not hold any information. It represents which context other components read or provide. Typically, you will use SomeContext in components above to specify the context value, and call useContext(SomeContext) in components below to read it. The context object has a few properties:\n\nSomeContext lets you provide the context value to components.\nSomeContext.Consumer is an alternative and rarely used way to read the context value.\nSomeContext.Provider is a legacy way to provide the context value before React 19.\nSomeContext Provider \n\nWrap your components into a context provider to specify the value of this context for all components inside:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n\n      <Page />\n\n    </ThemeContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\nNote\n\nStarting in React 19, you can render <SomeContext> as a provider.\n\nIn older versions of React, use <SomeContext.Provider>.\n\nProps \nvalue: The value that you want to pass to all the components reading this context inside this provider, no matter how deep. The context value can be of any type. A component calling useContext(SomeContext) inside of the provider receives the value of the innermost corresponding context provider above it.\nSomeContext.Consumer \n\nBefore useContext existed, there was an older way to read context:\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  // 🟡 Legacy way (not recommended)\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext.Consumer>\n\n      {theme => (\n\n        <button className={theme} />\n\n      )}\n\n    </ThemeContext.Consumer>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAlthough this older way still works, newly written code should read context with useContext() instead:\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  // ✅ Recommended way\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  return <button className={theme} />;\n\n}\nProps \nchildren: A function. React will call the function you pass with the current context value determined by the same algorithm as useContext() does, and render the result you return from this function. React will also re-run this function and update the UI whenever the context from the parent components changes.\nUsage \nCreating context \n\nContext lets components pass information deep down without explicitly passing props.\n\nCall createContext outside any components to create one or more contexts.\n\nimport { createContext } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nconst AuthContext = createContext(null);\n\ncreateContext returns a context object. Components can read context by passing it to useContext():\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Profile() {\n\n  const currentUser = useContext(AuthContext);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nBy default, the values they receive will be the default values you have specified when creating the contexts. However, by itself this isn’t useful because the default values never change.\n\nContext is useful because you can provide other, dynamic values from your components:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark');\n\n  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState({ name: 'Taylor' });\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n\n      <AuthContext value={currentUser}>\n\n        <Page />\n\n      </AuthContext>\n\n    </ThemeContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNow the Page component and any components inside it, no matter how deep, will “see” the passed context values. If the passed context values change, React will re-render the components reading the context as well.\n\nRead more about reading and providing context and see examples.\n\nImporting and exporting context from a file \n\nOften, components in different files will need access to the same context. This is why it’s common to declare contexts in a separate file. Then you can use the export statement to make context available for other files:\n\n// Contexts.js\n\nimport { createContext } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport const ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nexport const AuthContext = createContext(null);\n\nComponents declared in other files can then use the import statement to read or provide this context:\n\n// Button.js\n\nimport { ThemeContext } from './Contexts.js';\n\n\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n// App.js\n\nimport { ThemeContext, AuthContext } from './Contexts.js';\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n\n      <AuthContext value={currentUser}>\n\n        <Page />\n\n      </AuthContext>\n\n    </ThemeContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis works similar to importing and exporting components.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI can’t find a way to change the context value \n\nCode like this specifies the default context value:\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nThis value never changes. React only uses this value as a fallback if it can’t find a matching provider above.\n\nTo make context change over time, add state and wrap components in a context provider.\n\nPREVIOUS\ncaptureOwnerStack\nNEXT\nlazy"

It needs to eventually resolve to an object whose .default property is a valid React component type, such as a function, memo, or a forwardRef component.\n\nUsage \nLazy-loading components with Suspense \n\nUsually, you import components with the static import declaration:\n\nimport MarkdownPreview from './MarkdownPreview.js';\n\nTo defer loading this component’s code until it’s rendered for the first time, replace this import with:\n\nimport { lazy } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MarkdownPreview = lazy(() => import('./MarkdownPreview.js'));\n\nThis code relies on dynamic import(), which might require support from your bundler or framework. Using this pattern requires that the lazy component you’re importing was exported as the default export.\n\nNow that your component’s code loads on demand, you also need to specify what should be displayed while it is loading. You can do this by wrapping the lazy component or any of its parents into a <Suspense> boundary:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <h2>Preview</h2>\n\n  <MarkdownPreview />\n\n</Suspense>\n\nIn this example, the code for MarkdownPreview won’t be loaded until you attempt to render it. If MarkdownPreview hasn’t loaded yet, Loading will be shown in its place.

This memoized version of your component will usually not be re-rendered when its parent component is re-rendered as long as its props have not changed. But React may still re-render it: memoization is a performance optimization, not a guarantee.\n\nimport { memo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst SomeComponent = memo(function SomeComponent(props) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nComponent: The component that you want to memoize. The memo does not modify this component, but returns a new, memoized component instead. Any valid React component, including functions and forwardRef components, is accepted.\n\noptional arePropsEqual: A function that accepts two arguments: the component’s previous props, and its new props. It should return true if the old and new props are equal: that is, if the component will render the same output and behave in the same way with the new props as with the old. Otherwise it should return false. Usually, you will not specify this function. By default, React will compare each prop with Object.is.\n\nReturns \n\nmemo returns a new React component. It behaves the same as the component provided to memo except that React will not always re-render it when its parent is being re-rendered unless its props have changed.\n\nUsage \nSkipping re-rendering when props are unchanged \n\nReact normally re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders. With memo, you can create a component that React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its new props are the same as the old props. Such a component is said to be memoized.\n\nTo memoize a component, wrap it in memo and use the value that it returns in place of your original component:\n\nconst Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n\n});\n\n\n\nexport default Greeting;\n\nA React component should always have pure rendering logic. This means that it must return the same output if its props, state, and context haven’t changed. By using memo, you are telling React that your component complies with this requirement, so React doesn’t need to re-render as long as its props haven’t changed. Even with memo, your component will re-render if its own state changes or if a context that it’s using changes.\n\nIn this example, notice that the Greeting component re-renders whenever name is changed (because that’s one of its props), but not when address is changed (because it’s not passed to Greeting as a prop):\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { memo, useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n  const [address, setAddress] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Name{': '}\n        <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Address{': '}\n        <input value={address} onChange={e => setAddress(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Greeting name={name} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {\n  console.log(\"Greeting was rendered at\", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());\n  return <h3>Hello{name && ', '}{name}!</h3>;\n});\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nYou should only rely on memo as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add memo to improve performance.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nShould you add memo everywhere? \nShow Details\nUpdating a memoized component using state \n\nEven when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when its own state changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { memo, useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n  const [address, setAddress] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Name{': '}\n        <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Address{': '}\n        <input value={address} onChange={e => setAddress(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Greeting name={name} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {\n  console.log('Greeting was rendered at', new Date().toLocaleTimeString());\n  const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState('Hello');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h3>{greeting}{name && ', '}{name}!</h3>\n      <GreetingSelector value={greeting} onChange={setGreeting} />\n    </>\n  );\n});\n\nfunction GreetingSelector({ value, onChange }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"radio\"\n          checked={value === 'Hello'}\n          onChange={e => onChange('Hello')}\n        />\n        Regular greeting\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"radio\"\n          checked={value === 'Hello and welcome'}\n          onChange={e => onChange('Hello and welcome')}\n        />\n        Enthusiastic greeting\n      </label>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIf you set a state variable to its current value, React will skip re-rendering your component even without memo. You may still see your component function being called an extra time, but the result will be discarded.\n\nUpdating a memoized component using a context \n\nEven when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when a context that it’s using changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, memo, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark');\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    setTheme(theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Switch theme\n      </button>\n      <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />\n    </ThemeContext>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {\n  console.log(\"Greeting was rendered at\", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  return (\n    <h3 className={theme}>Hello, {name}!</h3>\n  );\n});\n\n\nShow more\n\nTo make your component re-render only when a part of some context changes, split your component in two. Read what you need from the context in the outer component, and pass it down to a memoized child as a prop.\n\nMinimizing props changes \n\nWhen you use memo, your component re-renders whenever any prop is not shallowly equal to what it was previously. This means that React compares every prop in your component with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. Note that Object.is(3, 3) is true, but Object.is({}, {}) is false.\n\nTo get the most out of memo, minimize the times that the props change. For example, if the prop is an object, prevent the parent component from re-creating that object every time by using useMemo:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\n\n\n  const person = useMemo(\n\n    () => ({ name, age }),\n\n    [name, age]\n\n  );\n\n\n\n  return <Profile person={person} />;\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst Profile = memo(function Profile({ person }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nA better way to minimize props changes is to make sure the component accepts the minimum necessary information in its props. For example, it could accept individual values instead of a whole object:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\n  return <Profile name={name} age={age} />;\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst Profile = memo(function Profile({ name, age }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nEven individual values can sometimes be projected to ones that change less frequently. For example, here a component accepts a boolean indicating the presence of a value rather than the value itself:\n\nfunction GroupsLanding({ person }) {\n\n  const hasGroups = person.groups !== null;\n\n  return <CallToAction hasGroups={hasGroups} />;\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst CallToAction = memo(function CallToAction({ hasGroups }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nWhen you need to pass a function to memoized component, either declare it outside your component so that it never changes, or useCallback to cache its definition between re-renders.\n\nSpecifying a custom comparison function \n\nIn rare cases it may be infeasible to minimize the props changes of a memoized component. In that case, you can provide a custom comparison function, which React will use to compare the old and new props instead of using shallow equality. This function is passed as a second argument to memo. It should return true only if the new props would result in the same output as the old props; otherwise it should return false.\n\nconst Chart = memo(function Chart({ dataPoints }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}, arePropsEqual);\n\n\n\nfunction arePropsEqual(oldProps, newProps) {\n\n  return (\n\n    oldProps.dataPoints.length === newProps.dataPoints.length &&\n\n    oldProps.dataPoints.every((oldPoint, index) => {\n\n      const newPoint = newProps.dataPoints[index];\n\n      return oldPoint.x === newPoint.x && oldPoint.y === newPoint.y;\n\n    })\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIf you do this, use the Performance panel in your browser developer tools to make sure that your comparison function is actually faster than re-rendering the component. You might be surprised.\n\nWhen you do performance measurements, make sure that React is running in the production mode.\n\nPitfall\n\nIf you provide a custom arePropsEqual implementation, you must compare every prop, including functions. Functions often close over the props and state of parent components. If you return true when oldProps.onClick !== newProps.onClick, your component will keep “seeing” the props and state from a previous render inside its onClick handler, leading to very confusing bugs.\n\nAvoid doing deep equality checks inside arePropsEqual unless you are 100% sure that the data structure you’re working with has a known limited depth. Deep equality checks can become incredibly slow and can freeze your app for many seconds if someone changes the data structure later.\n\nDo I still need React.memo if I use React Compiler? \n\nWhen you enable React Compiler, you typically don’t need React.memo anymore. The compiler automatically optimizes component re-rendering for you.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nWithout React Compiler, you need React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders:\n\n// Parent re-renders every second\n\nfunction Parent() {\n\n  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const interval = setInterval(() => {\n\n      setSeconds(s => s + 1);\n\n    }, 1000);\n\n    return () => clearInterval(interval);\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <h1>Seconds: {seconds}</h1>\n\n      <ExpensiveChild name=\"John\" />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\n// Without memo, this re-renders every second even though props don't change\n\nconst ExpensiveChild = memo(function ExpensiveChild({ name }) {\n\n  console.log('ExpensiveChild rendered');\n\n  return <div>Hello, {name}!</div>;\n\n});\n\nWith React Compiler enabled, the same optimization happens automatically:\n\n// No memo needed - compiler prevents re-renders automatically\n\nfunction ExpensiveChild({ name }) {\n\n  console.log('ExpensiveChild rendered');\n\n  return <div>Hello, {name}!</div>;\n\n}\n\nHere’s the key part of what the React Compiler generates:\n\nfunction Parent() {\n\n  const $ = _c(7);\n\n  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);\n\n  // ... other code ...\n\n\n\n  let t3;\n\n  if ($[4] === Symbol.for(\"react.memo_cache_sentinel\")) {\n\n    t3 = <ExpensiveChild name=\"John\" />;\n\n    $[4] = t3;\n\n  } else {\n\n    t3 = $[4];\n\n  }\n\n  // ... return statement ...\n\n}\n\nNotice the highlighted lines: The compiler wraps <ExpensiveChild name=\"John\" /> in a cache check. Since the name prop is always \"John\", this JSX is created once and reused on every parent re-render. This is exactly what React.memo does - it prevents the child from re-rendering when its props haven’t changed.\n\nThe React Compiler automatically:\n\nTracks that the name prop passed to ExpensiveChild hasn’t changed\nReuses the previously created JSX for <ExpensiveChild name=\"John\" />\nSkips re-rendering ExpensiveChild entirely\n\nThis means you can safely remove React.memo from your components when using React Compiler. The compiler provides the same optimization automatically, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n\nNote\n\nThe compiler’s optimization is actually more comprehensive than React.memo. It also memoizes intermediate values and expensive computations within your components, similar to combining React.memo with useMemo throughout your component tree.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy component re-renders when a prop is an object, array, or function \n\nReact compares old and new props by shallow equality: that is, it considers whether each new prop is reference-equal to the old prop. If you create a new object or array each time the parent is re-rendered, even if the individual elements are each the same, React will still consider it to be changed. Similarly, if you create a new function when rendering the parent component, React will consider it to have changed even if the function has the same definition. To avoid this, simplify props or memoize props in the parent component.\n\nPREVIOUS\nlazy\nNEXT\nstartTransition"

It searches upwards and does not consider context providers in the component from which you’re calling use(context).\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, use } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n      <Form />\n    </ThemeContext>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button show={true}>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button show={false}>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const theme = use(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <section className={className}>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Button({ show, children }) {\n  if (show) {\n    const theme = use(ThemeContext);\n    const className = 'button-' + theme;\n    return (\n      <button className={className}>\n        {children}\n      </button>\n    );\n  }\n  return false\n}\n\n\nShow more\nStreaming data from the server to the client \n\nData can be streamed from the server to the client by passing a Promise as a prop from a Server Component to a Client Component.\n\nimport { fetchMessage } from './lib.js';\n\nimport { Message } from './message.js';\n\n\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const messagePromise = fetchMessage();\n\n  return (\n\n    <Suspense fallback={<p>waiting for message...</p>}>\n\n      <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />\n\n    </Suspense>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe Client Component then takes the Promise it received as a prop and passes it to the use API. This allows the Client Component to read the value from the Promise that was initially created by the Server Component.\n\n// message.js\n\n'use client';\n\n\n\nimport { use } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport function Message({ messagePromise }) {\n\n  const messageContent = use(messagePromise);\n\n  return <p>Here is the message: {messageContent}</p>;\n\n}\n\nBecause Message is wrapped in Suspense, the fallback will be displayed until the Promise is resolved. When the Promise is resolved, the value will be read by the use API and the Message component will replace the Suspense fallback.\n\nmessage.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Message({ messagePromise }) {\n  const messageContent = use(messagePromise);\n  return <p>Here is the message: {messageContent}</p>;\n}\n\nexport function MessageContainer({ messagePromise }) {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<p>⌛Downloading message...</p>}>\n      <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nWhen passing a Promise from a Server Component to a Client Component, its resolved value must be serializable to pass between server and client. Data types like functions aren’t serializable and cannot be the resolved value of such a Promise.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nShould I resolve a Promise in a Server or Client Component? \nShow Details\nDealing with rejected Promises \n\nIn some cases a Promise passed to use could be rejected. You can handle rejected Promises by either:\n\nDisplaying an error to users with an Error Boundary.\nProviding an alternative value with Promise.catch\nPitfall\n\nuse cannot be called in a try-catch block. Instead of a try-catch block wrap your component in an Error Boundary, or provide an alternative value to use with the Promise’s .catch method.\n\nDisplaying an error to users with an Error Boundary \n\nIf you’d like to display an error to your users when a Promise is rejected, you can use an Error Boundary. To use an Error Boundary, wrap the component where you are calling the use API in an Error Boundary. If the Promise passed to use is rejected the fallback for the Error Boundary will be displayed.\n\nmessage.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from \"react\";\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\nexport function MessageContainer({ messagePromise }) {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>⚠️Something went wrong</p>}>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>⌛Downloading message...</p>}>\n        <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Message({ messagePromise }) {\n  const content = use(messagePromise);\n  return <p>Here is the message: {content}</p>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nProviding an alternative value with Promise.catch \n\nIf you’d like to provide an alternative value when the Promise passed to use is rejected you can use the Promise’s catch method.\n\nimport { Message } from './message.js';\n\n\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const messagePromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n\n    reject();\n\n  }).catch(() => {\n\n    return \"no new message found.\";\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <Suspense fallback={<p>waiting for message...</p>}>\n\n      <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />\n\n    </Suspense>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nTo use the Promise’s catch method, call catch on the Promise object. catch takes a single argument: a function that takes an error message as an argument. Whatever is returned by the function passed to catch will be used as the resolved value of the Promise.\n\nTroubleshooting \n“Suspense Exception: This is not a real error!” \n\nYou are either calling use outside of a React Component or Hook function, or calling use in a try–catch block. If you are calling use inside a try–catch block, wrap your component in an Error Boundary, or call the Promise’s catch to catch the error and resolve the Promise with another value. See these examples.\n\nIf you are calling use outside a React Component or Hook function, move the use call to a React Component or Hook function.\n\nfunction MessageComponent({messagePromise}) {\n\n  function download() {\n\n    // ❌ the function calling `use` is not a Component or Hook\n\n    const message = use(messagePromise);\n\n    // ...\n\nInstead, call use outside any component closures, where the function that calls use is a Component or Hook.\n\nfunction MessageComponent({messagePromise}) {\n\n  // ✅ `use` is being called from a component. \n\n  const message = use(messagePromise);\n\n  // ...\nPREVIOUS\nstartTransition\nNEXT\nexperimental_taintObjectReference"

For example, if you have a tainted user object, const userInfo = {name: user.name, ssn: user.ssn} or {...user} will create new objects which are not tainted. taintObjectReference only protects against simple mistakes when the object is passed through to a Client Component unchanged.\nPitfall\n\nDo not rely on just tainting for security. Tainting an object doesn’t prevent leaking of every possible derived value. For example, the clone of a tainted object will create a new untainted object. Using data from a tainted object (e.g. {secret: taintedObj.secret}) will create a new value or object that is not tainted. Tainting is a layer of protection; a secure app will have multiple layers of protection, well designed APIs, and isolation patterns.\n\nUsage \nPrevent user data from unintentionally reaching the client \n\nA Client Component should never accept objects that carry sensitive data. Ideally, the data fetching functions should not expose data that the current user should not have access to. Sometimes mistakes happen during refactoring. To protect against these mistakes happening down the line we can “taint” the user object in our data API.\n\nimport {experimental_taintObjectReference} from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport async function getUser(id) {\n\n  const user = await db`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;\n\n  experimental_taintObjectReference(\n\n    'Do not pass the entire user object to the client.

New values created by uppercasing tainted values, concatenating tainted string values into a larger string, converting tainted values to base64, substringing tainted values, and other similar transformations are not tainted unless you explicitly call taintUniqueValue on these newly created values.\nDo not use taintUniqueValue to protect low-entropy values such as PIN codes or phone numbers. If any value in a request is controlled by an attacker, they could infer which value is tainted by enumerating all possible values of the secret.\nUsage \nPrevent a token from being passed to Client Components \n\nTo ensure that sensitive information such as passwords, session tokens, or other unique values do not inadvertently get passed to Client Components, the taintUniqueValue function provides a layer of protection. When a value is tainted, any attempt to pass it to a Client Component will result in an error.\n\nThe lifetime argument defines the duration for which the value remains tainted. For values that should remain tainted indefinitely, objects like globalThis or process can serve as the lifetime argument. These objects have a lifespan that spans the entire duration of your app’s execution.\n\nimport {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';\n\n\n\nexperimental_taintUniqueValue(\n\n  'Do not pass a user password to the client.',\n\n  globalThis,\n\n  process.env.SECRET_KEY\n\n);\n\nIf the tainted value’s lifespan is tied to a object, the lifetime should be the object that encapsulates the value. This ensures the tainted value remains protected for the lifetime of the encapsulating object.\n\nimport {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport async function getUser(id) {\n\n  const user = await db`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;\n\n  experimental_taintUniqueValue(\n\n    'Do not pass a user session token to the client.',\n\n    user,\n\n    user.session.token\n\n  );\n\n  return user;\n\n}\n\nIn this example, the user object serves as the lifetime argument. If this object gets stored in a global cache or is accessible by another request, the session token remains tainted.\n\nPitfall\n\nDo not rely solely on tainting for security. Tainting a value doesn’t block every possible derived value. For example, creating a new value by upper casing a tainted string will not taint the new value.\n\nimport {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst password = 'correct horse battery staple';\n\n\n\nexperimental_taintUniqueValue(\n\n  'Do not pass the password to the client.',\n\n  globalThis,\n\n  password\n\n);\n\n\n\nconst uppercasePassword = password.toUpperCase() // `uppercasePassword` is not tainted\n\nIn this example, the constant password is tainted. Then password is used to create a new value uppercasePassword by calling the toUpperCase method on password. The newly created uppercasePassword is not tainted.\n\nOther similar ways of deriving new values from tainted values like concatenating it into a larger string, converting it to base64, or returning a substring create untained values.\n\nTainting only protects against simple mistakes like explicitly passing secret values to the client. Mistakes in calling the taintUniqueValue like using a global store outside of React, without the corresponding lifetime object, can cause the tainted value to become untainted.

This includes:\n\n<aside>\n<audio>\n<b>\n<base>\n<bdi>\n<bdo>\n<blockquote>\n<body>\n<br>\n<button>\n<canvas>\n<caption>\n<cite>\n<code>\n<col>\n<colgroup>\n<data>\n<datalist>\n<dd>\n<del>\n<details>\n<dfn>\n<dialog>\n<div>\n<dl>\n<dt>\n<em>\n<embed>\n<fieldset>\n<figcaption>\n<figure>\n<footer>\n<form>\n<h1>\n<head>\n<header>\n<hgroup>\n<hr>\n<html>\n<i>\n<iframe>\n<img>\n<input>\n<ins>\n<kbd>\n<label>\n<legend>\n<li>\n<link>\n<main>\n<map>\n<mark>\n<menu>\n<meta>\n<meter>\n<nav>\n<noscript>\n<object>\n<ol>\n<optgroup>\n<option>\n<output>\n<p>\n<picture>\n<pre>\n<progress>\n<q>\n<rp>\n<rt>\n<ruby>\n<s>\n<samp>\n<script>\n<section>\n<select>\n<slot>\n<small>\n<source>\n<span>\n<strong>\n<style>\n<sub>\n<summary>\n<sup>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<td>\n<template>\n<textarea>\n<tfoot>\n<th>\n<thead>\n<time>\n<title>\n<tr>\n<track>\n<u>\n<ul>\n<var>\n<video>\n<wbr>\nNote\n\nSimilar to the DOM standard, React uses a camelCase convention for prop names. For example, you’ll write tabIndex instead of tabindex. You can convert existing HTML to JSX with an online converter.\n\nCustom HTML elements \n\nIf you render a tag with a dash, like <my-element>, React will assume you want to render a custom HTML element.\n\nIf you render a built-in browser HTML element with an is attribute, it will also be treated as a custom element.\n\nSetting values on custom elements \n\nCustom elements have two methods of passing data into them:\n\nAttributes: Which are displayed in markup and can only be set to string values\nProperties: Which are not displayed in markup and can be set to arbitrary JavaScript values\n\nBy default, React will pass values bound in JSX as attributes:\n\n<my-element value=\"Hello, world!\"></my-element>\n\nNon-string JavaScript values passed to custom elements will be serialized by default:\n\n// Will be passed as `\"1,2,3\"` as the output of `[1,2,3].toString()`\n\n<my-element value={[1,2,3]}></my-element>\n\nReact will, however, recognize an custom element’s property as one that it may pass arbitrary values to if the property name shows up on the class during construction:\n\nMyElement.js\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport class MyElement extends HTMLElement {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    // The value here will be overwritten by React \n    // when initialized as an element\n    this.value = undefined;\n  }\n\n  connectedCallback() {\n    this.innerHTML = this.value.join(\", \");\n  }\n}\n\n\nListening for events on custom elements \n\nA common pattern when using custom elements is that they may dispatch CustomEvents rather than accept a function to call when an event occur. You can listen for these events using an on prefix when binding to the event via JSX.\n\nMyElement.js\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport function App() {\n  return (\n    <my-element\n      onspeak={e => console.log(e.detail.message)}\n    ></my-element>\n  )\n}\n\n\nNote\n\nEvents are case-sensitive and support dashes (-). Preserve the casing of the event and include all dashes when listening for custom element’s events:\n\n// Listens for `say-hi` events\n\n<my-element onsay-hi={console.log}></my-element>\n\n// Listens for `sayHi` events\n\n<my-element onsayHi={console.log}></my-element>\nAll SVG components \n\nReact supports all built-in browser SVG components. This includes:\n\n<a>\n<animate>\n<animateMotion>\n<animateTransform>\n<circle>\n<clipPath>\n<defs>\n<desc>\n<discard>\n<ellipse>\n<feBlend>\n<feColorMatrix>\n<feComponentTransfer>\n<feComposite>\n<feConvolveMatrix>\n<feDiffuseLighting>\n<feDisplacementMap>\n<feDistantLight>\n<feDropShadow>\n<feFlood>\n<feFuncA>\n<feFuncB>\n<feFuncG>\n<feFuncR>\n<feGaussianBlur>\n<feImage>\n<feMerge>\n<feMergeNode>\n<feMorphology>\n<feOffset>\n<fePointLight>\n<feSpecularLighting>\n<feSpotLight>\n<feTile>\n<feTurbulence>\n<filter>\n<foreignObject>\n<g>\n<hatch>\n<hatchpath>\n<image>\n<line>\n<linearGradient>\n<marker>\n<mask>\n<metadata>\n<mpath>\n<path>\n<pattern>\n<polygon>\n<polyline>\n<radialGradient>\n<rect>\n<script>\n<set>\n<stop>\n<style>\n<svg>\n<switch>\n<symbol>\n<text>\n<textPath>\n<title>\n<tspan>\n<use>\n<view>\nNote\n\nSimilar to the DOM standard, React uses a camelCase convention for prop names. For example, you’ll write tabIndex instead of tabindex. You can convert existing SVG to JSX with an online converter.\n\nNamespaced attributes also have to be written without the colon:\n\nxlink:actuate becomes xlinkActuate.\nxlink:arcrole becomes xlinkArcrole.\nxlink:href becomes xlinkHref.\nxlink:role becomes xlinkRole.\nxlink:show becomes xlinkShow.\nxlink:title becomes xlinkTitle.\nxlink:type becomes xlinkType.\nxml:base becomes xmlBase.\nxml:lang becomes xmlLang.\nxml:space becomes xmlSpace.\nxmlns:xlink becomes xmlnsXlink.\nPREVIOUS\nuseFormStatus\nNEXT\nCommon (e.g. <div>)"

Specifies the content inside the component. When you use JSX, you will usually specify the children prop implicitly by nesting tags like <div><span /></div>.\n\ndangerouslySetInnerHTML: An object of the form { __html: '<p>some html</p>' } with a raw HTML string inside. Overrides the innerHTML property of the DOM node and displays the passed HTML inside. This should be used with extreme caution! If the HTML inside isn’t trusted (for example, if it’s based on user data), you risk introducing an XSS vulnerability. Read more about using dangerouslySetInnerHTML.\n\nref: A ref object from useRef or createRef, or a ref callback function, or a string for legacy refs. Your ref will be filled with the DOM element for this node. Read more about manipulating the DOM with refs.\n\nsuppressContentEditableWarning: A boolean. If true, suppresses the warning that React shows for elements that both have children and contentEditable={true} (which normally do not work together). Use this if you’re building a text input library that manages the contentEditable content manually.\n\nsuppressHydrationWarning: A boolean. If you use server rendering, normally there is a warning when the server and the client render different content. In some rare cases (like timestamps), it is very hard or impossible to guarantee an exact match. If you set suppressHydrationWarning to true, React will not warn you about mismatches in the attributes and the content of that element. It only works one level deep, and is intended to be used as an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. Read about suppressing hydration errors.\n\nstyle: An object with CSS styles, for example { fontWeight: 'bold', margin: 20 }. Similarly to the DOM style property, the CSS property names need to be written as camelCase, for example fontWeight instead of font-weight. You can pass strings or numbers as values. If you pass a number, like width: 100, React will automatically append px (“pixels”) to the value unless it’s a unitless property. We recommend using style only for dynamic styles where you don’t know the style values ahead of time. In other cases, applying plain CSS classes with className is more efficient. Read more about className and style.\n\nThese standard DOM props are also supported for all built-in components:\n\naccessKey: A string. Specifies a keyboard shortcut for the element. Not generally recommended.\naria-*: ARIA attributes let you specify the accessibility tree information for this element. See ARIA attributes for a complete reference. In React, all ARIA attribute names are exactly the same as in HTML.\nautoCapitalize: A string. Specifies whether and how the user input should be capitalized.\nclassName: A string. Specifies the element’s CSS class name. Read more about applying CSS styles.\ncontentEditable: A boolean. If true, the browser lets the user edit the rendered element directly. This is used to implement rich text input libraries like Lexical. React warns if you try to pass React children to an element with contentEditable={true} because React will not be able to update its content after user edits.\ndata-*: Data attributes let you attach some string data to the element, for example data-fruit=\"banana\". In React, they are not commonly used because you would usually read data from props or state instead.\ndir: Either 'ltr' or 'rtl'. Specifies the text direction of the element.\ndraggable: A boolean. Specifies whether the element is draggable. Part of HTML Drag and Drop API.\nenterKeyHint: A string. Specifies which action to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards.\nhtmlFor: A string. For <label> and <output>, lets you associate the label with some control. Same as for HTML attribute. React uses the standard DOM property names (htmlFor) instead of HTML attribute names.\nhidden: A boolean or a string. Specifies whether the element should be hidden.\nid: A string. Specifies a unique identifier for this element, which can be used to find it later or connect it with other elements. Generate it with useId to avoid clashes between multiple instances of the same component.\nis: A string. If specified, the component will behave like a custom element.\ninputMode: A string. Specifies what kind of keyboard to display (for example, text, number or telephone).\nitemProp: A string. Specifies which property the element represents for structured data crawlers.\nlang: A string. Specifies the language of the element.\nonAnimationEnd: An AnimationEvent handler function.

When that <div> DOM node is removed, React will call your the cleanup function returned from the callback.\n\nReact will also call your ref callback whenever you pass a different ref callback. In the above example, (node) => { ... } is a different function on every render. When your component re-renders, the previous function will be called with null as the argument, and the next function will be called with the DOM node.\n\nParameters \nnode: A DOM node. React will pass you the DOM node when the ref gets attached. Unless you pass the same function reference for the ref callback on every render, the callback will get temporarily cleanup and re-create during every re-render of the component.\nNote\nReact 19 added cleanup functions for ref callbacks. \n\nTo support backwards compatibility, if a cleanup function is not returned from the ref callback, node will be called with null when the ref is detached. This behavior will be removed in a future version.\n\nReturns \noptional cleanup function: When the ref is detached, React will call the cleanup function. If a function is not returned by the ref callback, React will call the callback again with null as the argument when the ref gets detached. This behavior will be removed in a future version.\nCaveats \nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function.\nWhen you pass a different ref callback, React will call the previous callback’s cleanup function if provided. If no cleanup function is defined, the ref callback will be called with null as the argument. The next function will be called with the DOM node.\nReact event object \n\nYour event handlers will receive a React event object. It is also sometimes known as a “synthetic event”.\n\n<button onClick={e => {\n\n  console.log(e); // React event object\n\n}} />\n\nIt conforms to the same standard as the underlying DOM events, but fixes some browser inconsistencies.\n\nSome React events do not map directly to the browser’s native events. For example in onMouseLeave, e.nativeEvent will point to a mouseout event. The specific mapping is not part of the public API and may change in the future. If you need the underlying browser event for some reason, read it from e.nativeEvent.\n\nProperties \n\nReact event objects implement some of the standard Event properties:\n\nbubbles: A boolean. Returns whether the event bubbles through the DOM.\ncancelable: A boolean. Returns whether the event can be canceled.\ncurrentTarget: A DOM node. Returns the node to which the current handler is attached in the React tree.\ndefaultPrevented: A boolean. Returns whether preventDefault was called.\neventPhase: A number. Returns which phase the event is currently in.\nisTrusted: A boolean. Returns whether the event was initiated by user.\ntarget: A DOM node. Returns the node on which the event has occurred (which could be a distant child).\ntimeStamp: A number. Returns the time when the event occurred.\n\nAdditionally, React event objects provide these properties:\n\nnativeEvent: A DOM Event. The original browser event object.\nMethods \n\nReact event objects implement some of the standard Event methods:\n\npreventDefault(): Prevents the default browser action for the event.\nstopPropagation(): Stops the event propagation through the React tree.\n\nAdditionally, React event objects provide these methods:\n\nisDefaultPrevented(): Returns a boolean value indicating whether preventDefault was called.\nisPropagationStopped(): Returns a boolean value indicating whether stopPropagation was called.\npersist(): Not used with React DOM. With React Native, call this to read event’s properties after the event.\nisPersistent(): Not used with React DOM. With React Native, returns whether persist has been called.\nCaveats \nThe values of currentTarget, eventPhase, target, and type reflect the values your React code expects. Under the hood, React attaches event handlers at the root, but this is not reflected in React event objects.

It works like the class attribute in HTML:\n\n<img className=\"avatar\" />\n\nThen you write the CSS rules for it in a separate CSS file:\n\n/* In your CSS */\n\n.avatar {\n\n  border-radius: 50%;\n\n}\n\nReact does not prescribe how you add CSS files. In the simplest case, you’ll add a <link> tag to your HTML. If you use a build tool or a framework, consult its documentation to learn how to add a CSS file to your project.\n\nSometimes, the style values depend on data. Use the style attribute to pass some styles dynamically:\n\n<img\n\n  className=\"avatar\"\n\n  style={{\n\n    width: user.imageSize,\n\n    height: user.imageSize\n\n  }}\n\n/>\n\nIn the above example, style={{}} is not a special syntax, but a regular {} object inside the style={ } JSX curly braces. We recommend only using the style attribute when your styles depend on JavaScript variables.\n\nApp.js\nAvatar.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function Avatar({ user }) {\n  return (\n    <img\n      src={user.imageUrl}\n      alt={'Photo of ' + user.name}\n      className=\"avatar\"\n      style={{\n        width: user.imageSize,\n        height: user.imageSize\n      }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow to apply multiple CSS classes conditionally? \nShow Details\nManipulating a DOM node with a ref \n\nSometimes, you’ll need to get the browser DOM node associated with a tag in JSX. For example, if you want to focus an <input> when a button is clicked, you need to call focus() on the browser <input> DOM node.\n\nTo obtain the browser DOM node for a tag, declare a ref and pass it as the ref attribute to that tag:\n\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport default function Form() {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <input ref={inputRef} />\n\n    // ...\n\nReact will put the DOM node into inputRef.current after it’s been rendered to the screen.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    inputRef.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input ref={inputRef} />\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Focus the input\n      </button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nRead more about manipulating DOM with refs and check out more examples.\n\nFor more advanced use cases, the ref attribute also accepts a callback function.\n\nDangerously setting the inner HTML \n\nYou can pass a raw HTML string to an element like so:\n\nconst markup = { __html: '<p>some raw html</p>' };\n\nreturn <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={markup} />;\n\nThis is dangerous. As with the underlying DOM innerHTML property, you must exercise extreme caution! Unless the markup is coming from a completely trusted source, it is trivial to introduce an XSS vulnerability this way.\n\nFor example, if you use a Markdown library that converts Markdown to HTML, you trust that its parser doesn’t contain bugs, and the user only sees their own input, you can display the resulting HTML like this:\n\npackage.json\nApp.js\nMarkdownPreview.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Remarkable } from 'remarkable';\n\nconst md = new Remarkable();\n\nfunction renderMarkdownToHTML(markdown) {\n  // This is ONLY safe because the output HTML\n  // is shown to the same user, and because you\n  // trust this Markdown parser to not have bugs.\n  const renderedHTML = md.render(markdown);\n  return {__html: renderedHTML};\n}\n\nexport default function MarkdownPreview({ markdown }) {\n  const markup = renderMarkdownToHTML(markdown);\n  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={markup} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe {__html} object should be created as close to where the HTML is generated as possible, like the above example does in the renderMarkdownToHTML function. This ensures that all raw HTML being used in your code is explicitly marked as such, and that only variables that you expect to contain HTML are passed to dangerouslySetInnerHTML. It is not recommended to create the object inline like <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: markup}} />.\n\nTo see why rendering arbitrary HTML is dangerous, replace the code above with this:\n\nconst post = {\n\n  // Imagine this content is stored in the database.\n\n  content: `<img src=\"\" onerror='alert(\"you were hacked\")'>`\n\n};\n\n\n\nexport default function MarkdownPreview() {\n\n  // 🔴 SECURITY HOLE: passing untrusted input to dangerouslySetInnerHTML\n\n  const markup = { __html: post.content };\n\n  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={markup} />;\n\n}\n\nThe code embedded in the HTML will run. A hacker could use this security hole to steal user information or to perform actions on their behalf. Only use dangerouslySetInnerHTML with trusted and sanitized data.\n\nHandling mouse events \n\nThis example shows some common mouse events and when they fire.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function MouseExample() {\n  return (\n    <div\n      onMouseEnter={e => console.log('onMouseEnter (parent)')}\n      onMouseLeave={e => console.log('onMouseLeave (parent)')}\n    >\n      <button\n        onClick={e => console.log('onClick (first button)')}\n        onMouseDown={e => console.log('onMouseDown (first button)')}\n        onMouseEnter={e => console.log('onMouseEnter (first button)')}\n        onMouseLeave={e => console.log('onMouseLeave (first button)')}\n        onMouseOver={e => console.log('onMouseOver (first button)')}\n        onMouseUp={e => console.log('onMouseUp (first button)')}\n      >\n        First button\n      </button>\n      <button\n        onClick={e => console.log('onClick (second button)')}\n        onMouseDown={e => console.log('onMouseDown (second button)')}\n        onMouseEnter={e => console.log('onMouseEnter (second button)')}\n        onMouseLeave={e => console.log('onMouseLeave (second button)')}\n        onMouseOver={e => console.log('onMouseOver (second button)')}\n        onMouseUp={e => console.log('onMouseUp (second button)')}\n      >\n        Second button\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nHandling pointer events \n\nThis example shows some common pointer events and when they fire.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function PointerExample() {\n  return (\n    <div\n      onPointerEnter={e => console.log('onPointerEnter (parent)')}\n      onPointerLeave={e => console.log('onPointerLeave (parent)')}\n      style={{ padding: 20, backgroundColor: '#ddd' }}\n    >\n      <div\n        onPointerDown={e => console.log('onPointerDown (first child)')}\n        onPointerEnter={e => console.log('onPointerEnter (first child)')}\n        onPointerLeave={e => console.log('onPointerLeave (first child)')}\n        onPointerMove={e => console.log('onPointerMove (first child)')}\n        onPointerUp={e => console.log('onPointerUp (first child)')}\n        style={{ padding: 20, backgroundColor: 'lightyellow' }}\n      >\n        First child\n      </div>\n      <div\n        onPointerDown={e => console.log('onPointerDown (second child)')}\n        onPointerEnter={e => console.log('onPointerEnter (second child)')}\n        onPointerLeave={e => console.log('onPointerLeave (second child)')}\n        onPointerMove={e => console.log('onPointerMove (second child)')}\n        onPointerUp={e => console.log('onPointerUp (second child)')}\n        style={{ padding: 20, backgroundColor: 'lightblue' }}\n      >\n        Second child\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nHandling focus events \n\nIn React, focus events bubble.

When a URL is passed to action the form will behave like the HTML form component. When a function is passed to action the function will handle the form submission in a Transition following the Action prop pattern. The function passed to action may be async and will be called with a single argument containing the form data of the submitted form. The action prop can be overridden by a formAction attribute on a <button>, <input type=\"submit\">, or <input type=\"image\"> component.\n\nCaveats \nWhen a function is passed to action or formAction the HTTP method will be POST regardless of value of the method prop.\nUsage \nHandle form submission on the client \n\nPass a function to the action prop of form to run the function when the form is submitted. formData will be passed to the function as an argument so you can access the data submitted by the form. This differs from the conventional HTML action, which only accepts URLs. After the action function succeeds, all uncontrolled field elements in the form are reset.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function Search() {\n  function search(formData) {\n    const query = formData.get(\"query\");\n    alert(`You searched for '${query}'`);\n  }\n  return (\n    <form action={search}>\n      <input name=\"query\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Search</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nHandle form submission with a Server Function \n\nRender a <form> with an input and submit button. Pass a Server Function (a function marked with 'use server') to the action prop of form to run the function when the form is submitted.\n\nPassing a Server Function to <form action> allow users to submit forms without JavaScript enabled or before the code has loaded. This is beneficial to users who have a slow connection, device, or have JavaScript disabled and is similar to the way forms work when a URL is passed to the action prop.\n\nYou can use hidden form fields to provide data to the <form>’s action. The Server Function will be called with the hidden form field data as an instance of FormData.\n\nimport { updateCart } from './lib.js';\n\n\n\nfunction AddToCart({productId}) {\n\n  async function addToCart(formData) {\n\n    'use server'\n\n    const productId = formData.get('productId')\n\n    await updateCart(productId)\n\n  }\n\n  return (\n\n    <form action={addToCart}>\n\n        <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"productId\" value={productId} />\n\n        <button type=\"submit\">Add to Cart</button>\n\n    </form>\n\n\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn lieu of using hidden form fields to provide data to the <form>’s action, you can call the bind method to supply it with extra arguments. This will bind a new argument (productId) to the function in addition to the formData that is passed as an argument to the function.\n\nimport { updateCart } from './lib.js';\n\n\n\nfunction AddToCart({productId}) {\n\n  async function addToCart(productId, formData) {\n\n    \"use server\";\n\n    await updateCart(productId)\n\n  }\n\n  const addProductToCart = addToCart.bind(null, productId);\n\n  return (\n\n    <form action={addProductToCart}>\n\n      <button type=\"submit\">Add to Cart</button>\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nWhen <form> is rendered by a Server Component, and a Server Function is passed to the <form>’s action prop, the form is progressively enhanced.\n\nDisplay a pending state during form submission \n\nTo display a pending state when a form is being submitted, you can call the useFormStatus Hook in a component rendered in a <form> and read the pending property returned.\n\nHere, we use the pending property to indicate the form is submitting.\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useFormStatus } from \"react-dom\";\nimport { submitForm } from \"./actions.js\";\n\nfunction Submit() {\n  const { pending } = useFormStatus();\n  return (\n    <button type=\"submit\" disabled={pending}>\n      {pending ? \"Submitting...\" : \"Submit\"}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Form({ action }) {\n  return (\n    <form action={action}>\n      <Submit />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <Form action={submitForm} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTo learn more about the useFormStatus Hook see the reference documentation.\n\nOptimistically updating form data \n\nThe useOptimistic Hook provides a way to optimistically update the user interface before a background operation, like a network request, completes. In the context of forms, this technique helps to make apps feel more responsive. When a user submits a form, instead of waiting for the server’s response to reflect the changes, the interface is immediately updated with the expected outcome.\n\nFor example, when a user types a message into the form and hits the “Send” button, the useOptimistic Hook allows the message to immediately appear in the list with a “Sending…” label, even before the message is actually sent to a server. This “optimistic” approach gives the impression of speed and responsiveness. The form then attempts to truly send the message in the background. Once the server confirms the message has been received, the “Sending…” label is removed.\n\nApp.js\nactions.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useOptimistic, useState, useRef } from \"react\";\nimport { deliverMessage } from \"./actions.js\";\n\nfunction Thread({ messages, sendMessage }) {\n  const formRef = useRef();\n  async function formAction(formData) {\n    addOptimisticMessage(formData.get(\"message\"));\n    formRef.current.reset();\n    await sendMessage(formData);\n  }\n  const [optimisticMessages, addOptimisticMessage] = useOptimistic(\n    messages,\n    (state, newMessage) => [\n      ...state,\n      {\n        text: newMessage,\n        sending: true\n      }\n    ]\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {optimisticMessages.map((message, index) => (\n        <div key={index}>\n          {message.text}\n          {!!message.sending && <small> (Sending...)</small>}\n        </div>\n      ))}\n      <form action={formAction} ref={formRef}>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"message\" placeholder=\"Hello!\" />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([\n    { text: \"Hello there!\", sending: false, key: 1 }\n  ]);\n  async function sendMessage(formData) {\n    const sentMessage = await deliverMessage(formData.get(\"message\"));\n    setMessages((messages) => [...messages, { text: sentMessage }]);\n  }\n  return <Thread messages={messages} sendMessage={sendMessage} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nHandling form submission errors \n\nIn some cases the function called by a <form>’s action prop throws an error.

Overrides the parent <form action> for type=\"submit\" and type=\"image\". When a URL is passed to action the form will behave like a standard HTML form. When a function is passed to formAction the function will handle the form submission. See <form action>.\n\nYou can make an input controlled by passing one of these props:\n\nchecked: A boolean. For a checkbox input or a radio button, controls whether it is selected.\nvalue: A string. For a text input, controls its text. (For a radio button, specifies its form data.)\n\nWhen you pass either of them, you must also pass an onChange handler that updates the passed value.\n\nThese <input> props are only relevant for uncontrolled inputs:\n\ndefaultChecked: A boolean. Specifies the initial value for type=\"checkbox\" and type=\"radio\" inputs.\ndefaultValue: A string. Specifies the initial value for a text input.\n\nThese <input> props are relevant both for uncontrolled and controlled inputs:\n\naccept: A string. Specifies which filetypes are accepted by a type=\"file\" input.\nalt: A string. Specifies the alternative image text for a type=\"image\" input.\ncapture: A string. Specifies the media (microphone, video, or camera) captured by a type=\"file\" input.\nautoComplete: A string. Specifies one of the possible autocomplete behaviors.\nautoFocus: A boolean. If true, React will focus the element on mount.\ndirname: A string. Specifies the form field name for the element’s directionality.\ndisabled: A boolean. If true, the input will not be interactive and will appear dimmed.\nchildren: <input> does not accept children.\nform: A string. Specifies the id of the <form> this input belongs to. If omitted, it’s the closest parent form.\nformAction: A string. Overrides the parent <form action> for type=\"submit\" and type=\"image\".\nformEnctype: A string. Overrides the parent <form enctype> for type=\"submit\" and type=\"image\".\nformMethod: A string. Overrides the parent <form method> for type=\"submit\" and type=\"image\".\nformNoValidate: A string. Overrides the parent <form noValidate> for type=\"submit\" and type=\"image\".\nformTarget: A string. Overrides the parent <form target> for type=\"submit\" and type=\"image\".\nheight: A string. Specifies the image height for type=\"image\".\nlist: A string. Specifies the id of the <datalist> with the autocomplete options.\nmax: A number. Specifies the maximum value of numerical and datetime inputs.\nmaxLength: A number. Specifies the maximum length of text and other inputs.\nmin: A number. Specifies the minimum value of numerical and datetime inputs.\nminLength: A number. Specifies the minimum length of text and other inputs.\nmultiple: A boolean. Specifies whether multiple values are allowed for <type=\"file\" and type=\"email\".\nname: A string. Specifies the name for this input that’s submitted with the form.\nonChange: An Event handler function. Required for controlled inputs. Fires immediately when the input’s value is changed by the user (for example, it fires on every keystroke). Behaves like the browser input event.\nonChangeCapture: A version of onChange that fires in the capture phase.\nonInput: An Event handler function. Fires immediately when the value is changed by the user. For historical reasons, in React it is idiomatic to use onChange instead which works similarly.\nonInputCapture: A version of onInput that fires in the capture phase.\nonInvalid: An Event handler function. Fires if an input fails validation on form submit. Unlike the built-in invalid event, the React onInvalid event bubbles.\nonInvalidCapture: A version of onInvalid that fires in the capture phase.\nonSelect: An Event handler function. Fires after the selection inside the <input> changes. React extends the onSelect event to also fire for empty selection and on edits (which may affect the selection).\nonSelectCapture: A version of onSelect that fires in the capture phase.\npattern: A string. Specifies the pattern that the value must match.\nplaceholder: A string. Displayed in a dimmed color when the input value is empty.\nreadOnly: A boolean. If true, the input is not editable by the user.\nrequired: A boolean. If true, the value must be provided for the form to submit.\nsize: A number. Similar to setting width, but the unit depends on the control.\nsrc: A string. Specifies the image source for a type=\"image\" input.\nstep: A positive number or an 'any' string. Specifies the distance between valid values.\ntype: A string. One of the input types.\nwidth: A string. Specifies the image width for a type=\"image\" input.\nCaveats \nCheckboxes need checked (or defaultChecked), not value (or defaultValue).\nIf a text input receives a string value prop, it will be treated as controlled.\nIf a checkbox or a radio button receives a boolean checked prop, it will be treated as controlled.\nAn input can’t be both controlled and uncontrolled at the same time.\nAn input cannot switch between being controlled or uncontrolled over its lifetime.\nEvery controlled input needs an onChange event handler that synchronously updates its backing value.\nUsage \nDisplaying inputs of different types \n\nTo display an input, render an <input> component. By default, it will be a text input. You can pass type=\"checkbox\" for a checkbox, type=\"radio\" for a radio button, or one of the other input types.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function MyForm() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Text input: <input name=\"myInput\" />\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <label>\n        Checkbox: <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"myCheckbox\" />\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <p>\n        Radio buttons:\n        <label>\n          <input type=\"radio\" name=\"myRadio\" value=\"option1\" />\n          Option 1\n        </label>\n        <label>\n          <input type=\"radio\" name=\"myRadio\" value=\"option2\" />\n          Option 2\n        </label>\n        <label>\n          <input type=\"radio\" name=\"myRadio\" value=\"option3\" />\n          Option 3\n        </label>\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nProviding a label for an input \n\nTypically, you will place every <input> inside a <label> tag. This tells the browser that this label is associated with that input. When the user clicks the label, the browser will automatically focus the input. It’s also essential for accessibility: a screen reader will announce the label caption when the user focuses the associated input.\n\nIf you can’t nest <input> into a <label>, associate them by passing the same ID to <input id> and <label htmlFor>. To avoid conflicts between multiple instances of one component, generate such an ID with useId.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useId } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const ageInputId = useId();\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Your first name:\n        <input name=\"firstName\" />\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <label htmlFor={ageInputId}>Your age:</label>\n      <input id={ageInputId} name=\"age\" type=\"number\" />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nProviding an initial value for an input \n\nYou can optionally specify the initial value for any input.

It will call your <form onSubmit> event handler. By default, the browser will send the form data to the current URL and refresh the page. You can override that behavior by calling e.preventDefault(). Read the form data with new FormData(e.target).\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function MyForm() {\n  function handleSubmit(e) {\n    // Prevent the browser from reloading the page\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    // Read the form data\n    const form = e.target;\n    const formData = new FormData(form);\n\n    // You can pass formData as a fetch body directly:\n    fetch('/some-api', { method: form.method, body: formData });\n\n    // Or you can work with it as a plain object:\n    const formJson = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries());\n    console.log(formJson);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form method=\"post\" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <label>\n        Text input: <input name=\"myInput\" defaultValue=\"Some initial value\" />\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <label>\n        Checkbox: <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"myCheckbox\" defaultChecked={true} />\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <p>\n        Radio buttons:\n        <label><input type=\"radio\" name=\"myRadio\" value=\"option1\" /> Option 1</label>\n        <label><input type=\"radio\" name=\"myRadio\" value=\"option2\" defaultChecked={true} /> Option 2</label>\n        <label><input type=\"radio\" name=\"myRadio\" value=\"option3\" /> Option 3</label>\n      </p>\n      <hr />\n      <button type=\"reset\">Reset form</button>\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit form</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nGive a name to every <input>, for example <input name=\"firstName\" defaultValue=\"Taylor\" />. The name you specified will be used as a key in the form data, for example { firstName: \"Taylor\" }.\n\nPitfall\n\nBy default, a <button> inside a <form> without a type attribute will submit it. This can be surprising! If you have your own custom Button React component, consider using <button type=\"button\"> instead of <button> (with no type). Then, to be explicit, use <button type=\"submit\"> for buttons that are supposed to submit the form.\n\nControlling an input with a state variable \n\nAn input like <input /> is uncontrolled. Even if you pass an initial value like <input defaultValue=\"Initial text\" />, your JSX only specifies the initial value. It does not control what the value should be right now.\n\nTo render a controlled input, pass the value prop to it (or checked for checkboxes and radios). React will force the input to always have the value you passed. Usually, you would do this by declaring a state variable:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(''); // Declare a state variable...\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <input\n\n      value={firstName} // ...force the input's value to match the state variable...\n\n      onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} // ... and update the state variable on any edits!\n\n    />\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nA controlled input makes sense if you needed state anyway—for example, to re-render your UI on every edit:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <label>\n\n        First name:\n\n        <input value={firstName} onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} />\n\n      </label>\n\n      {firstName !== '' && <p>Your name is {firstName}.</p>}\n\n      ...\n\nIt’s also useful if you want to offer multiple ways to adjust the input state (for example, by clicking a button):\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  const [age, setAge] = useState('');\n\n  const ageAsNumber = Number(age);\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <label>\n\n        Age:\n\n        <input\n\n          value={age}\n\n          onChange={e => setAge(e.target.value)}\n\n          type=\"number\"\n\n        />\n\n        <button onClick={() => setAge(ageAsNumber + 10)}>\n\n          Add 10 years\n\n        </button>\n\nThe value you pass to controlled components should not be undefined or null. If you need the initial value to be empty (such as with the firstName field below), initialize your state variable to an empty string ('').\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n  const [age, setAge] = useState('20');\n  const ageAsNumber = Number(age);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        First name:\n        <input\n          value={firstName}\n          onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Age:\n        <input\n          value={age}\n          onChange={e => setAge(e.target.value)}\n          type=\"number\"\n        />\n        <button onClick={() => setAge(ageAsNumber + 10)}>\n          Add 10 years\n        </button>\n      </label>\n      {firstName !== '' &&\n        <p>Your name is {firstName}.</p>\n      }\n      {ageAsNumber > 0 &&\n        <p>Your age is {ageAsNumber}.</p>\n      }\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nIf you pass value without onChange, it will be impossible to type into the input. When you control an input by passing some value to it, you force it to always have the value you passed. So if you pass a state variable as a value but forget to update that state variable synchronously during the onChange event handler, React will revert the input after every keystroke back to the value that you specified.\n\nOptimizing re-rendering on every keystroke \n\nWhen you use a controlled input, you set the state on every keystroke. If the component containing your state re-renders a large tree, this can get slow. There’s a few ways you can optimize re-rendering performance.\n\nFor example, suppose you start with a form that re-renders all page content on every keystroke:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <form>\n\n        <input value={firstName} onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} />\n\n      </form>\n\n      <PageContent />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nSince <PageContent /> doesn’t rely on the input state, you can move the input state into its own component:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <SignupForm />\n\n      <PageContent />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction SignupForm() {\n\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n\n    <form>\n\n      <input value={firstName} onChange={e => setFirstName(e.target.value)} />\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis significantly improves performance because now only SignupForm re-renders on every keystroke.\n\nIf there is no way to avoid re-rendering (for example, if PageContent depends on the search input’s value), useDeferredValue lets you keep the controlled input responsive even in the middle of a large re-render.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy text input doesn’t update when I type into it \n\nIf you render an input with value but no onChange, you will see an error in the console:\n\n// 🔴 Bug: controlled text input with no onChange handler\n\n<input value={something} />\nConsole\nYou provided a value prop to a form field without an onChange handler. This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use defaultValue. Otherwise, set either onChange or readOnly.\n\nAs the error message suggests, if you only wanted to specify the initial value, pass defaultValue instead:\n\n// ✅ Good: uncontrolled input with an initial value\n\n<input defaultValue={something} />\n\nIf you want to control this input with a state variable, specify an onChange handler:\n\n// ✅ Good: controlled input with onChange\n\n<input value={something} onChange={e => setSomething(e.target.value)} />\n\nIf the value is intentionally read-only, add a readOnly prop to suppress the error:\n\n// ✅ Good: readonly controlled input without on change\n\n<input value={something} readOnly={true} />\nMy checkbox doesn’t update when I click on it \n\nIf you render a checkbox with checked but no onChange, you will see an error in the console:\n\n// 🔴 Bug: controlled checkbox with no onChange handler\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\" checked={something} />\nConsole\nYou provided a checked prop to a form field without an onChange handler. This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use defaultChecked. Otherwise, set either onChange or readOnly.\n\nAs the error message suggests, if you only wanted to specify the initial value, pass defaultChecked instead:\n\n// ✅ Good: uncontrolled checkbox with an initial value\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\" defaultChecked={something} />\n\nIf you want to control this checkbox with a state variable, specify an onChange handler:\n\n// ✅ Good: controlled checkbox with onChange\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\" checked={something} onChange={e => setSomething(e.target.checked)} />\nPitfall\n\nYou need to read e.target.checked rather than e.target.value for checkboxes.\n\nIf the checkbox is intentionally read-only, add a readOnly prop to suppress the error:\n\n// ✅ Good: readonly controlled input without on change\n\n<input type=\"checkbox\" checked={something} readOnly={true} />\nMy input caret jumps to the beginning on every keystroke \n\nIf you control an input, you must update its state variable to the input’s value from the DOM during onChange.\n\nYou can’t update it to something other than e.target.value (or e.target.checked for checkboxes):\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // 🔴 Bug: updating an input to something other than e.target.value\n\n  setFirstName(e.target.value.toUpperCase());\n\n}\n\nYou also can’t update it asynchronously:\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // 🔴 Bug: updating an input asynchronously\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    setFirstName(e.target.value);\n\n  }, 100);\n\n}\n\nTo fix your code, update it synchronously to e.target.value:\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // ✅ Updating a controlled input to e.target.value synchronously\n\n  setFirstName(e.target.value);\n\n}\n\nIf this doesn’t fix the problem, it’s possible that the input gets removed and re-added from the DOM on every keystroke. This can happen if you’re accidentally resetting state on every re-render, for example if the input or one of its parents always receives a different key attribute, or if you nest component function definitions (which is not supported and causes the “inner” component to always be considered a different tree).\n\nI’m getting an error: “A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled” \n\nIf you provide a value to the component, it must remain a string throughout its lifetime.\n\nYou cannot pass value={undefined} first and later pass value=\"some string\" because React won’t know whether you want the component to be uncontrolled or controlled. A controlled component should always receive a string value, not null or undefined.\n\nIf your value is coming from an API or a state variable, it might be initialized to null or undefined. In that case, either set it to an empty string ('') initially, or pass value={someValue ?? ''} to ensure value is a string.\n\nSimilarly, if you pass checked to a checkbox, ensure it’s always a boolean.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<form>\nNEXT\n<option>"

Controls which option is selected. Every value string match the value of some <option> nested inside the <select>.\n\nWhen you pass value, you must also pass an onChange handler that updates the passed value.\n\nIf your <select> is uncontrolled, you may pass the defaultValue prop instead:\n\ndefaultValue: A string (or an array of strings for multiple={true}). Specifies the initially selected option.\n\nThese <select> props are relevant both for uncontrolled and controlled select boxes:\n\nautoComplete: A string. Specifies one of the possible autocomplete behaviors.\nautoFocus: A boolean. If true, React will focus the element on mount.\nchildren: <select> accepts <option>, <optgroup>, and <datalist> components as children. You can also pass your own components as long as they eventually render one of the allowed components. If you pass your own components that eventually render <option> tags, each <option> you render must have a value.\ndisabled: A boolean. If true, the select box will not be interactive and will appear dimmed.\nform: A string. Specifies the id of the <form> this select box belongs to. If omitted, it’s the closest parent form.\nmultiple: A boolean. If true, the browser allows multiple selection.\nname: A string. Specifies the name for this select box that’s submitted with the form.\nonChange: An Event handler function. Required for controlled select boxes. Fires immediately when the user picks a different option. Behaves like the browser input event.\nonChangeCapture: A version of onChange that fires in the capture phase.\nonInput: An Event handler function. Fires immediately when the value is changed by the user. For historical reasons, in React it is idiomatic to use onChange instead which works similarly.\nonInputCapture: A version of onInput that fires in the capture phase.\nonInvalid: An Event handler function. Fires if an input fails validation on form submit. Unlike the built-in invalid event, the React onInvalid event bubbles.\nonInvalidCapture: A version of onInvalid that fires in the capture phase.\nrequired: A boolean. If true, the value must be provided for the form to submit.\nsize: A number. For multiple={true} selects, specifies the preferred number of initially visible items.\nCaveats \nUnlike in HTML, passing a selected attribute to <option> is not supported. Instead, use <select defaultValue> for uncontrolled select boxes and <select value> for controlled select boxes.\nIf a select box receives a value prop, it will be treated as controlled.\nA select box can’t be both controlled and uncontrolled at the same time.\nA select box cannot switch between being controlled or uncontrolled over its lifetime.\nEvery controlled select box needs an onChange event handler that synchronously updates its backing value.\nUsage \nDisplaying a select box with options \n\nRender a <select> with a list of <option> components inside to display a select box.

This tells the browser that this label is associated with that select box. When the user clicks the label, the browser will automatically focus the select box. It’s also essential for accessibility: a screen reader will announce the label caption when the user focuses the select box.\n\nIf you can’t nest <select> into a <label>, associate them by passing the same ID to <select id> and <label htmlFor>.

It will call your <form onSubmit> event handler. By default, the browser will send the form data to the current URL and refresh the page. You can override that behavior by calling e.preventDefault(). Read the form data with new FormData(e.target).\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function EditPost() {\n  function handleSubmit(e) {\n    // Prevent the browser from reloading the page\n    e.preventDefault();\n    // Read the form data\n    const form = e.target;\n    const formData = new FormData(form);\n    // You can pass formData as a fetch body directly:\n    fetch('/some-api', { method: form.method, body: formData });\n    // You can generate a URL out of it, as the browser does by default:\n    console.log(new URLSearchParams(formData).toString());\n    // You can work with it as a plain object.\n    const formJson = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries());\n    console.log(formJson); // (!)

The name you specified will be used as a key in the form data, for example { selectedFruit: \"orange\" }.\n\nIf you use <select multiple={true}>, the FormData you’ll read from the form will include each selected value as a separate name-value pair. Look closely at the console logs in the example above.\n\nPitfall\n\nBy default, any <button> inside a <form> will submit it. This can be surprising! If you have your own custom Button React component, consider returning <button type=\"button\"> instead of <button>. Then, to be explicit, use <button type=\"submit\"> for buttons that are supposed to submit the form.\n\nControlling a select box with a state variable \n\nA select box like <select /> is uncontrolled. Even if you pass an initially selected value like <select defaultValue=\"orange\" />, your JSX only specifies the initial value, not the value right now.\n\nTo render a controlled select box, pass the value prop to it. React will force the select box to always have the value you passed. Typically, you will control a select box by declaring a state variable:\n\nfunction FruitPicker() {\n\n  const [selectedFruit, setSelectedFruit] = useState('orange'); // Declare a state variable...\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <select\n\n      value={selectedFruit} // ...force the select's value to match the state variable...\n\n      onChange={e => setSelectedFruit(e.target.value)} // ... and update the state variable on any change!\n\n    >\n\n      <option value=\"apple\">Apple</option>\n\n      <option value=\"banana\">Banana</option>\n\n      <option value=\"orange\">Orange</option>\n\n    </select>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis is useful if you want to re-render some part of the UI in response to every selection.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function FruitPicker() {\n  const [selectedFruit, setSelectedFruit] = useState('orange');\n  const [selectedVegs, setSelectedVegs] = useState(['corn', 'tomato']);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Pick a fruit:\n        <select\n          value={selectedFruit}\n          onChange={e => setSelectedFruit(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"apple\">Apple</option>\n          <option value=\"banana\">Banana</option>\n          <option value=\"orange\">Orange</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <label>\n        Pick all your favorite vegetables:\n        <select\n          multiple={true}\n          value={selectedVegs}\n          onChange={e => {\n            const options = [...e.target.selectedOptions];\n            const values = options.map(option => option.value);\n            setSelectedVegs(values);\n          }}\n        >\n          <option value=\"cucumber\">Cucumber</option>\n          <option value=\"corn\">Corn</option>\n          <option value=\"tomato\">Tomato</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <p>Your favorite fruit: {selectedFruit}</p>\n      <p>Your favorite vegetables: {selectedVegs.join(', ')}</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nIf you pass value without onChange, it will be impossible to select an option. When you control a select box by passing some value to it, you force it to always have the value you passed. So if you pass a state variable as a value but forget to update that state variable synchronously during the onChange event handler, React will revert the select box after every keystroke back to the value that you specified.\n\nUnlike in HTML, passing a selected attribute to an individual <option> is not supported.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<progress>\nNEXT\n<textarea>"

This will render a read-only field. If the field should be mutable use defaultValue. Otherwise, set either onChange or readOnly.\n\nAs the error message suggests, if you only wanted to specify the initial value, pass defaultValue instead:\n\n// ✅ Good: uncontrolled text area with an initial value\n\n<textarea defaultValue={something} />\n\nIf you want to control this text area with a state variable, specify an onChange handler:\n\n// ✅ Good: controlled text area with onChange\n\n<textarea value={something} onChange={e => setSomething(e.target.value)} />\n\nIf the value is intentionally read-only, add a readOnly prop to suppress the error:\n\n// ✅ Good: readonly controlled text area without on change\n\n<textarea value={something} readOnly={true} />\nMy text area caret jumps to the beginning on every keystroke \n\nIf you control a text area, you must update its state variable to the text area’s value from the DOM during onChange.\n\nYou can’t update it to something other than e.target.value:\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // 🔴 Bug: updating an input to something other than e.target.value\n\n  setFirstName(e.target.value.toUpperCase());\n\n}\n\nYou also can’t update it asynchronously:\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // 🔴 Bug: updating an input asynchronously\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    setFirstName(e.target.value);\n\n  }, 100);\n\n}\n\nTo fix your code, update it synchronously to e.target.value:\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // ✅ Updating a controlled input to e.target.value synchronously\n\n  setFirstName(e.target.value);\n\n}\n\nIf this doesn’t fix the problem, it’s possible that the text area gets removed and re-added from the DOM on every keystroke. This can happen if you’re accidentally resetting state on every re-render. For example, this can happen if the text area or one of its parents always receives a different key attribute, or if you nest component definitions (which is not allowed in React and causes the “inner” component to remount on every render).\n\nI’m getting an error: “A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled” \n\nIf you provide a value to the component, it must remain a string throughout its lifetime.\n\nYou cannot pass value={undefined} first and later pass value=\"some string\" because React won’t know whether you want the component to be uncontrolled or controlled. A controlled component should always receive a string value, not null or undefined.\n\nIf your value is coming from an API or a state variable, it might be initialized to null or undefined. In that case, either set it to an empty string ('') initially, or pass value={someValue ?? ''} to ensure value is a string.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<select>\nNEXT\n<link>"

You can render <link> from any component and React will in most cases place the corresponding DOM element in the document head.\n\n<link rel=\"icon\" href=\"favicon.ico\" />\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nProps \n\n<link> supports all common element props.\n\nrel: a string, required. Specifies the relationship to the resource. React treats links with rel=\"stylesheet\" differently from other links.\n\nThese props apply when rel=\"stylesheet\":\n\nprecedence: a string. Tells React where to rank the <link> DOM node relative to others in the document <head>, which determines which stylesheet can override the other. React will infer that precedence values it discovers first are “lower” and precedence values it discovers later are “higher”. Many style systems can work fine using a single precedence value because style rules are atomic.

Specifies the name of an alternative stylesheet.\n\nThese props apply when rel=\"stylesheet\" but disable React’s special treatment of stylesheets:\n\ndisabled: a boolean. Disables the stylesheet.\nonError: a function. Called when the stylesheet fails to load.\nonLoad: a function. Called when the stylesheet finishes being loaded.\n\nThese props apply when rel=\"preload\" or rel=\"modulepreload\":\n\nas: a string. The type of resource. Its possible values are audio, document, embed, fetch, font, image, object, script, style, track, video, worker.\nimageSrcSet: a string. Applicable only when as=\"image\". Specifies the source set of the image.\nimageSizes: a string. Applicable only when as=\"image\". Specifies the sizes of the image.\n\nThese props apply when rel=\"icon\" or rel=\"apple-touch-icon\":\n\nsizes: a string. The sizes of the icon.\n\nThese props apply in all cases:\n\nhref: a string. The URL of the linked resource.\ncrossOrigin: a string. The CORS policy to use. Its possible values are anonymous and use-credentials. It is required when as is set to \"fetch\".\nreferrerPolicy: a string. The Referrer header to send when fetching. Its possible values are no-referrer-when-downgrade (the default), no-referrer, origin, origin-when-cross-origin, and unsafe-url.\nfetchPriority: a string. Suggests a relative priority for fetching the resource. The possible values are auto (the default), high, and low.\nhrefLang: a string. The language of the linked resource.\nintegrity: a string. A cryptographic hash of the resource, to verify its authenticity.\ntype: a string. The MIME type of the linked resource.\n\nProps that are not recommended for use with React:\n\nblocking: a string. If set to \"render\", instructs the browser not to render the page until the stylesheet is loaded. React provides more fine-grained control using Suspense.\nSpecial rendering behavior \n\nReact will always place the DOM element corresponding to the <link> component within the document’s <head>, regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered. The <head> is the only valid place for <link> to exist within the DOM, yet it’s convenient and keeps things composable if a component representing a specific page can render <link> components itself.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to this:\n\nIf the <link> has a rel=\"stylesheet\" prop, then it has to also have a precedence prop to get this special behavior. This is because the order of stylesheets within the document is significant, so React needs to know how to order this stylesheet relative to others, which you specify using the precedence prop. If the precedence prop is omitted, there is no special behavior.\nIf the <link> has an itemProp prop, there is no special behavior, because in this case it doesn’t apply to the document but instead represents metadata about a specific part of the page.\nIf the <link> has an onLoad or onError prop, because in that case you are managing the loading of the linked resource manually within your React component.\nSpecial behavior for stylesheets \n\nIn addition, if the <link> is to a stylesheet (namely, it has rel=\"stylesheet\" in its props), React treats it specially in the following ways:\n\nThe component that renders <link> will suspend while the stylesheet is loading.\nIf multiple components render links to the same stylesheet, React will de-duplicate them and only put a single link into the DOM. Two links are considered the same if they have the same href prop.\n\nThere are two exception to this special behavior:\n\nIf the link doesn’t have a precedence prop, there is no special behavior, because the order of stylesheets within the document is significant, so React needs to know how to order this stylesheet relative to others, which you specify using the precedence prop.\nIf you supply any of the onLoad, onError, or disabled props, there is no special behavior, because these props indicate that you are managing the loading of the stylesheet manually within your component.\n\nThis special treatment comes with two caveats:\n\nReact will ignore changes to props after the link has been rendered. (React will issue a warning in development if this happens.)\nReact may leave the link in the DOM even after the component that rendered it has been unmounted.\nUsage \nLinking to related resources \n\nYou can annotate the document with links to related resources such as an icon, canonical URL, or pingback. React will place this metadata within the document <head> regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered.\n\nApp.js\nShowRenderedHTML.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport ShowRenderedHTML from './ShowRenderedHTML.js';\n\nexport default function BlogPage() {\n  return (\n    <ShowRenderedHTML>\n      <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"favicon.ico\" />\n      <link rel=\"pingback\" href=\"http://www.example.com/xmlrpc.php\" />\n      <h1>My Blog</h1>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </ShowRenderedHTML>\n  );\n}\n\n\nLinking to a stylesheet \n\nIf a component depends on a certain stylesheet in order to be displayed correctly, you can render a link to that stylesheet within the component. Your component will suspend while the stylesheet is loading. You must supply the precedence prop, which tells React where to place this stylesheet relative to others — stylesheets with higher precedence can override those with lower precedence.\n\nNote\n\nWhen you want to use a stylesheet, it can be beneficial to call the preinit function. Calling this function may allow the browser to start fetching the stylesheet earlier than if you just render a <link> component, for example by sending an HTTP Early Hints response.\n\nApp.js\nShowRenderedHTML.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport ShowRenderedHTML from './ShowRenderedHTML.js';\n\nexport default function SiteMapPage() {\n  return (\n    <ShowRenderedHTML>\n      <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"sitemap.css\" precedence=\"medium\" />\n      <p>...</p>\n    </ShowRenderedHTML>\n  );\n}\n\n\nControlling stylesheet precedence \n\nStylesheets can conflict with each other, and when they do, the browser goes with the one that comes later in the document. React lets you control the order of stylesheets with the precedence prop. In this example, three components render stylesheets, and the ones with the same precedence are grouped together in the <head>.\n\nApp.js\nShowRenderedHTML.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport ShowRenderedHTML from './ShowRenderedHTML.js';\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <ShowRenderedHTML>\n      <FirstComponent />\n      <SecondComponent />\n      <ThirdComponent/>\n      ...\n    </ShowRenderedHTML>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction FirstComponent() {\n  return <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"first.css\" precedence=\"first\" />;\n}\n\nfunction SecondComponent() {\n  return <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"second.css\" precedence=\"second\" />;\n}\n\nfunction ThirdComponent() {\n  return <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"third.css\" precedence=\"first\" />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNote the precedence values themselves are arbitrary and their naming is up to you. React will infer that precedence values it discovers first are “lower” and precedence values it discovers later are “higher”.\n\nDeduplicated stylesheet rendering \n\nIf you render the same stylesheet from multiple components, React will place only a single <link> in the document head.\n\nApp.js\nShowRenderedHTML.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport ShowRenderedHTML from './ShowRenderedHTML.js';\n\nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <ShowRenderedHTML>\n      <Component />\n      <Component />\n      ...\n    </ShowRenderedHTML>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Component() {\n  return <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\" precedence=\"medium\" />;\n}\n\n\nAnnotating specific items within the document with links \n\nYou can use the <link> component with the itemProp prop to annotate specific items within the document with links to related resources. In this case, React will not place these annotations within the document <head> but will place them like any other React component.\n\n<section itemScope>\n\n  <h3>Annotating specific items</h3>\n\n  <link itemProp=\"author\" href=\"http://example.com/\" />\n\n  <p>...</p>\n\n</section>\nPREVIOUS\n<textarea>\nNEXT\n<meta>"

In every other way, the JSX you render into a portal acts as a child node of the React component that renders it. For example, the child can access the context provided by the parent tree, and events bubble up from children to parents according to the React tree.\n\nParameters \n\nchildren: Anything that can be rendered with React, such as a piece of JSX (e.g. <div /> or <SomeComponent />), a Fragment (<>...</>), a string or a number, or an array of these.\n\ndomNode: Some DOM node, such as those returned by document.getElementById(). The node must already exist. Passing a different DOM node during an update will cause the portal content to be recreated.\n\noptional key: A unique string or number to be used as the portal’s key.\n\nReturns \n\ncreatePortal returns a React node that can be included into JSX or returned from a React component. If React encounters it in the render output, it will place the provided children inside the provided domNode.\n\nCaveats \nEvents from portals propagate according to the React tree rather than the DOM tree. For example, if you click inside a portal, and the portal is wrapped in <div onClick>, that onClick handler will fire. If this causes issues, either stop the event propagation from inside the portal, or move the portal itself up in the React tree.\nUsage \nRendering to a different part of the DOM \n\nPortals let your components render some of their children into a different place in the DOM. This lets a part of your component “escape” from whatever containers it may be in. For example, a component can display a modal dialog or a tooltip that appears above and outside of the rest of the page.\n\nTo create a portal, render the result of createPortal with some JSX and the DOM node where it should go:\n\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <div style={{ border: '2px solid black' }}>\n\n      <p>This child is placed in the parent div.</p>\n\n      {createPortal(\n\n        <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>,\n\n        document.body\n\n      )}\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nReact will put the DOM nodes for the JSX you passed inside of the DOM node you provided.\n\nWithout a portal, the second <p> would be placed inside the parent <div>, but the portal “teleported” it into the document.body:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\n\nexport default function MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ border: '2px solid black' }}>\n      <p>This child is placed in the parent div.</p>\n      {createPortal(\n        <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>,\n        document.body\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nNotice how the second paragraph visually appears outside the parent <div> with the border. If you inspect the DOM structure with developer tools, you’ll see that the second <p> got placed directly into the <body>:\n\n<body>\n\n  <div id=\"root\">\n\n    ...\n\n      <div style=\"border: 2px solid black\">\n\n        <p>This child is placed inside the parent div.</p>\n\n      </div>\n\n    ...\n\n  </div>\n\n  <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>\n\n</body>\n\nA portal only changes the physical placement of the DOM node. In every other way, the JSX you render into a portal acts as a child node of the React component that renders it. For example, the child can access the context provided by the parent tree, and events still bubble up from children to parents according to the React tree.\n\nRendering a modal dialog with a portal \n\nYou can use a portal to create a modal dialog that floats above the rest of the page, even if the component that summons the dialog is inside a container with overflow: hidden or other styles that interfere with the dialog.\n\nIn this example, the two containers have styles that disrupt the modal dialog, but the one rendered into a portal is unaffected because, in the DOM, the modal is not contained within the parent JSX elements.\n\nApp.js\nNoPortalExample.js\nPortalExample.js\nModalContent.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport NoPortalExample from './NoPortalExample';\nimport PortalExample from './PortalExample';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"clipping-container\">\n        <NoPortalExample  />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"clipping-container\">\n        <PortalExample />\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nPitfall\n\nIt’s important to make sure that your app is accessible when using portals. For instance, you may need to manage keyboard focus so that the user can move the focus in and out of the portal in a natural way.\n\nFollow the WAI-ARIA Modal Authoring Practices when creating modals. If you use a community package, ensure that it is accessible and follows these guidelines.\n\nRendering React components into non-React server markup \n\nPortals can be useful if your React root is only part of a static or server-rendered page that isn’t built with React. For example, if your page is built with a server framework like Rails, you can create areas of interactivity within static areas such as sidebars. Compared with having multiple separate React roots, portals let you treat the app as a single React tree with shared state even though its parts render to different parts of the DOM.\n\nindex.js\nindex.html\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\n\nconst sidebarContentEl = document.getElementById('sidebar-content');\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <MainContent />\n      {createPortal(\n        <SidebarContent />,\n        sidebarContentEl\n      )}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction MainContent() {\n  return <p>This part is rendered by React</p>;\n}\n\nfunction SidebarContent() {\n  return <p>This part is also rendered by React!</p>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nRendering React components into non-React DOM nodes \n\nYou can also use a portal to manage the content of a DOM node that’s managed outside of React. For example, suppose you’re integrating with a non-React map widget and you want to render React content inside a popup. To do this, declare a popupContainer state variable to store the DOM node you’re going to render into:\n\nconst [popupContainer, setPopupContainer] = useState(null);\n\nWhen you create the third-party widget, store the DOM node returned by the widget so you can render into it:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  if (mapRef.current === null) {\n\n    const map = createMapWidget(containerRef.current);\n\n    mapRef.current = map;\n\n    const popupDiv = addPopupToMapWidget(map);\n\n    setPopupContainer(popupDiv);\n\n  }\n\n}, []);\n\nThis lets you use createPortal to render React content into popupContainer once it becomes available:\n\nreturn (\n\n  <div style={{ width: 250, height: 250 }} ref={containerRef}>\n\n    {popupContainer !== null && createPortal(\n\n      <p>Hello from React!</p>,\n\n      popupContainer\n\n    )}\n\n  </div>\n\n);\n\nHere is a complete example you can play with:\n\nApp.js\nmap-widget.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\nimport { createMapWidget, addPopupToMapWidget } from './map-widget.js';\n\nexport default function Map() {\n  const containerRef = useRef(null);\n  const mapRef = useRef(null);\n  const [popupContainer, setPopupContainer] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (mapRef.current === null) {\n      const map = createMapWidget(containerRef.current);\n      mapRef.current = map;\n      const popupDiv = addPopupToMapWidget(map);\n      setPopupContainer(popupDiv);\n    }\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div style={{ width: 250, height: 250 }} ref={containerRef}>\n      {popupContainer !== null && createPortal(\n        <p>Hello from React!</p>,\n        popupContainer\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPREVIOUS\nAPIs\nNEXT\nflushSync"

This ensures that the DOM is updated immediately.\n\nflushSync(callback)\nReference\nflushSync(callback)\nUsage\nFlushing updates for third-party integrations\nTroubleshooting\nI’m getting an error: “flushSync was called from inside a lifecycle method”\nReference \nflushSync(callback) \n\nCall flushSync to force React to flush any pending work and update the DOM synchronously.\n\nimport { flushSync } from 'react-dom';\n\n\n\nflushSync(() => {\n\n  setSomething(123);\n\n});\n\nMost of the time, flushSync can be avoided. Use flushSync as last resort.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \ncallback: A function. React will immediately call this callback and flush any updates it contains synchronously. It may also flush any pending updates, or Effects, or updates inside of Effects. If an update suspends as a result of this flushSync call, the fallbacks may be re-shown.\nReturns \n\nflushSync returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \nflushSync can significantly hurt performance. Use sparingly.\nflushSync may force pending Suspense boundaries to show their fallback state.\nflushSync may run pending Effects and synchronously apply any updates they contain before returning.\nflushSync may flush updates outside the callback when necessary to flush the updates inside the callback. For example, if there are pending updates from a click, React may flush those before flushing the updates inside the callback.\nUsage \nFlushing updates for third-party integrations \n\nWhen integrating with third-party code such as browser APIs or UI libraries, it may be necessary to force React to flush updates. Use flushSync to force React to flush any state updates inside the callback synchronously:\n\nflushSync(() => {\n\n  setSomething(123);\n\n});\n\n// By this line, the DOM is updated.\n\nThis ensures that, by the time the next line of code runs, React has already updated the DOM.\n\nUsing flushSync is uncommon, and using it often can significantly hurt the performance of your app. If your app only uses React APIs, and does not integrate with third-party libraries, flushSync should be unnecessary.\n\nHowever, it can be helpful for integrating with third-party code like browser APIs.\n\nSome browser APIs expect results inside of callbacks to be written to the DOM synchronously, by the end of the callback, so the browser can do something with the rendered DOM. In most cases, React handles this for you automatically. But in some cases it may be necessary to force a synchronous update.\n\nFor example, the browser onbeforeprint API allows you to change the page immediately before the print dialog opens. This is useful for applying custom print styles that allow the document to display better for printing. In the example below, you use flushSync inside of the onbeforeprint callback to immediately “flush” the React state to the DOM. Then, by the time the print dialog opens, isPrinting displays “yes”:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { flushSync } from 'react-dom';\n\nexport default function PrintApp() {\n  const [isPrinting, setIsPrinting] = useState(false);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    function handleBeforePrint() {\n      flushSync(() => {\n        setIsPrinting(true);\n      })\n    }\n\n    function handleAfterPrint() {\n      setIsPrinting(false);\n    }\n\n    window.addEventListener('beforeprint', handleBeforePrint);\n    window.addEventListener('afterprint', handleAfterPrint);\n    return () => {\n      window.removeEventListener('beforeprint', handleBeforePrint);\n      window.removeEventListener('afterprint', handleAfterPrint);\n    }\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>isPrinting: {isPrinting ? 'yes' : 'no'}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => window.print()}>\n        Print\n      </button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWithout flushSync, the print dialog will display isPrinting as “no”. This is because React batches the updates asynchronously and the print dialog is displayed before the state is updated.\n\nPitfall\n\nflushSync can significantly hurt performance, and may unexpectedly force pending Suspense boundaries to show their fallback state.\n\nMost of the time, flushSync can be avoided, so use flushSync as a last resort.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI’m getting an error: “flushSync was called from inside a lifecycle method” \n\nReact cannot flushSync in the middle of a render. If you do, it will noop and warn:\n\nConsole\nWarning: flushSync was called from inside a lifecycle method. React cannot flush when React is already rendering. Consider moving this call to a scheduler task or micro task.\n\nThis includes calling flushSync inside:\n\nrendering a component.\nuseLayoutEffect or useEffect hooks.\nClass component lifecycle methods.\n\nFor example, calling flushSync in an Effect will noop and warn:\n\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\n\nimport { flushSync } from 'react-dom';\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    // 🚩 Wrong: calling flushSync inside an effect\n\n    flushSync(() => {\n\n      setSomething(newValue);\n\n    });\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>;\n\n}\n\nTo fix this, you usually want to move the flushSync call to an event:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  // ✅ Correct: flushSync in event handlers is safe\n\n  flushSync(() => {\n\n    setSomething(newValue);\n\n  });\n\n}\n\nIf it’s difficult to move to an event, you can defer flushSync in a microtask:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // ✅ Correct: defer flushSync to a microtask\n\n  queueMicrotask(() => {\n\n    flushSync(() => {\n\n      setSomething(newValue);\n\n    });\n\n  });\n\n}, []);\n\nThis will allow the current render to finish and schedule another syncronous render to flush the updates.\n\nPitfall\n\nflushSync can significantly hurt performance, but this particular pattern is even worse for performance. Exhaust all other options before calling flushSync in a microtask as an escape hatch.\n\nPREVIOUS\ncreatePortal\nNEXT\npreconnect"

After you’ve created a root, you need to call root.render to display a React component inside of it:\n\nroot.render(<App />);\n\nAn app fully built with React will usually only have one createRoot call for its root component. A page that uses “sprinkles” of React for parts of the page may have as many separate roots as needed.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\ndomNode: A DOM element. React will create a root for this DOM element and allow you to call functions on the root, such as render to display rendered React content.\n\noptional options: An object with options for this React root.\n\noptional onCaughtError: Callback called when React catches an error in an Error Boundary.

Called with an error React throws, and an errorInfo object containing the componentStack. Some recoverable errors may include the original error cause as error.cause.\noptional identifierPrefix: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId. Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page.\nReturns \n\ncreateRoot returns an object with two methods: render and unmount.\n\nCaveats \nIf your app is server-rendered, using createRoot() is not supported. Use hydrateRoot() instead.\nYou’ll likely have only one createRoot call in your app. If you use a framework, it might do this call for you.\nWhen you want to render a piece of JSX in a different part of the DOM tree that isn’t a child of your component (for example, a modal or a tooltip), use createPortal instead of createRoot.\nroot.render(reactNode) \n\nCall root.render to display a piece of JSX (“React node”) into the React root’s browser DOM node.\n\nroot.render(<App />);\n\nReact will display <App /> in the root, and take over managing the DOM inside it.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \nreactNode: A React node that you want to display. This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App />, but you can also pass a React element constructed with createElement(), a string, a number, null, or undefined.\nReturns \n\nroot.render returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \n\nThe first time you call root.render, React will clear all the existing HTML content inside the React root before rendering the React component into it.\n\nIf your root’s DOM node contains HTML generated by React on the server or during the build, use hydrateRoot() instead, which attaches the event handlers to the existing HTML.\n\nIf you call render on the same root more than once, React will update the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest JSX you passed. React will decide which parts of the DOM can be reused and which need to be recreated by “matching it up” with the previously rendered tree. Calling render on the same root again is similar to calling the set function on the root component: React avoids unnecessary DOM updates.\n\nAlthough rendering is synchronous once it starts, root.render(...) is not. This means code after root.render() may run before any effects (useLayoutEffect, useEffect) of that specific render are fired. This is usually fine and rarely needs adjustment. In rare cases where effect timing matters, you can wrap root.render(...) in flushSync to ensure the initial render runs fully synchronously.\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\n\nroot.render(<App />);\n\n// 🚩 The HTML will not include the rendered <App /> yet:\n\nconsole.log(document.body.innerHTML);\nroot.unmount() \n\nCall root.unmount to destroy a rendered tree inside a React root.\n\nroot.unmount();\n\nAn app fully built with React will usually not have any calls to root.unmount.\n\nThis is mostly useful if your React root’s DOM node (or any of its ancestors) may get removed from the DOM by some other code. For example, imagine a jQuery tab panel that removes inactive tabs from the DOM. If a tab gets removed, everything inside it (including the React roots inside) would get removed from the DOM as well. In that case, you need to tell React to “stop” managing the removed root’s content by calling root.unmount. Otherwise, the components inside the removed root won’t know to clean up and free up global resources like subscriptions.\n\nCalling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the root and “detach” React from the root DOM node, including removing any event handlers or state in the tree.\n\nParameters \n\nroot.unmount does not accept any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\nroot.unmount returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \n\nCalling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the tree and “detach” React from the root DOM node.\n\nOnce you call root.unmount you cannot call root.render again on the same root. Attempting to call root.render on an unmounted root will throw a “Cannot update an unmounted root” error. However, you can create a new root for the same DOM node after the previous root for that node has been unmounted.\n\nUsage \nRendering an app fully built with React \n\nIf your app is fully built with React, create a single root for your entire app.\n\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\n\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\n\nroot.render(<App />);\n\nUsually, you only need to run this code once at startup. It will:\n\nFind the browser DOM node defined in your HTML.\nDisplay the React component for your app inside.\nindex.js\nindex.html\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport App from './App.js';\nimport './styles.css';\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(<App />);\n\n\n\nIf your app is fully built with React, you shouldn’t need to create any more roots, or to call root.render again.\n\nFrom this point on, React will manage the DOM of your entire app. To add more components, nest them inside the App component. When you need to update the UI, each of your components can do this by using state. When you need to display extra content like a modal or a tooltip outside the DOM node, render it with a portal.\n\nNote\n\nWhen your HTML is empty, the user sees a blank page until the app’s JavaScript code loads and runs:\n\n<div id=\"root\"></div>\n\nThis can feel very slow! To solve this, you can generate the initial HTML from your components on the server or during the build. Then your visitors can read text, see images, and click links before any of the JavaScript code loads. We recommend using a framework that does this optimization out of the box. Depending on when it runs, this is called server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG).\n\nPitfall\n\nApps using server rendering or static generation must call hydrateRoot instead of createRoot. React will then hydrate (reuse) the DOM nodes from your HTML instead of destroying and re-creating them.\n\nRendering a page partially built with React \n\nIf your page isn’t fully built with React, you can call createRoot multiple times to create a root for each top-level piece of UI managed by React. You can display different content in each root by calling root.render.\n\nHere, two different React components are rendered into two DOM nodes defined in the index.html file:\n\nindex.js\nindex.html\nComponents.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport './styles.css';\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport { Comments, Navigation } from './Components.js';\n\nconst navDomNode = document.getElementById('navigation');\nconst navRoot = createRoot(navDomNode); \nnavRoot.render(<Navigation />);\n\nconst commentDomNode = document.getElementById('comments');\nconst commentRoot = createRoot(commentDomNode); \ncommentRoot.render(<Comments />);\n\n\n\nYou could also create a new DOM node with document.createElement() and add it to the document manually.\n\nconst domNode = document.createElement('div');\n\nconst root = createRoot(domNode); \n\nroot.render(<Comment />);\n\ndocument.body.appendChild(domNode); // You can add it anywhere in the document\n\nTo remove the React tree from the DOM node and clean up all the resources used by it, call root.unmount.\n\nroot.unmount();\n\nThis is mostly useful if your React components are inside an app written in a different framework.\n\nUpdating a root component \n\nYou can call render more than once on the same root. As long as the component tree structure matches up with what was previously rendered, React will preserve the state. Notice how you can type in the input, which means that the updates from repeated render calls every second in this example are not destructive:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport './styles.css';\nimport App from './App.js';\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\n\nlet i = 0;\nsetInterval(() => {\n  root.render(<App counter={i} />);\n  i++;\n}, 1000);\n\n\n\nIt is uncommon to call render multiple times. Usually, your components will update state instead.\n\nError logging in production \n\nBy default, React will log all errors to the console. To implement your own error reporting, you can provide the optional error handler root options onUncaughtError, onCaughtError and onRecoverableError:\n\nimport { createRoot } from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nimport { reportCaughtError } from \"./reportError\";\n\n\n\nconst container = document.getElementById(\"root\");\n\nconst root = createRoot(container, {\n\n  onCaughtError: (error, errorInfo) => {\n\n    if (error.message !== \"Known error\") {\n\n      reportCaughtError({\n\n        error,\n\n        componentStack: errorInfo.componentStack,\n\n      });\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nThe onCaughtError option is a function called with two arguments:\n\nThe error that was thrown.\nAn errorInfo object that contains the componentStack of the error.\n\nTogether with onUncaughtError and onRecoverableError, you can can implement your own error reporting system:\n\nindex.js\nreportError.js\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createRoot } from \"react-dom/client\";\nimport App from \"./App.js\";\nimport {\n  onCaughtErrorProd,\n  onRecoverableErrorProd,\n  onUncaughtErrorProd,\n} from \"./reportError\";\n\nconst container = document.getElementById(\"root\");\nconst root = createRoot(container, {\n  // Keep in mind to remove these options in development to leverage\n  // React's default handlers or implement your own overlay for development.\n  // The handlers are only specfied unconditionally here for demonstration purposes.\n  onCaughtError: onCaughtErrorProd,\n  onRecoverableError: onRecoverableErrorProd,\n  onUncaughtError: onUncaughtErrorProd,\n});\nroot.render(<App />);\n\n\nShow more\nTroubleshooting \nI’ve created a root, but nothing is displayed \n\nMake sure you haven’t forgotten to actually render your app into the root:\n\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport App from './App.js';\n\n\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\n\nroot.render(<App />);\n\nUntil you do that, nothing is displayed.\n\nI’m getting an error: “You passed a second argument to root.render” \n\nA common mistake is to pass the options for createRoot to root.render(...):\n\nConsole\nWarning: You passed a second argument to root.render(…) but it only accepts one argument.\n\nTo fix, pass the root options to createRoot(...), not root.render(...):\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: root.render only takes one argument.\n\nroot.render(App, {onUncaughtError});\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: pass options to createRoot.\n\nconst root = createRoot(container, {onUncaughtError}); \n\nroot.render(<App />);\nI’m getting an error: “Target container is not a DOM element” \n\nThis error means that whatever you’re passing to createRoot is not a DOM node.\n\nIf you’re not sure what’s happening, try logging it:\n\nconst domNode = document.getElementById('root');\n\nconsole.log(domNode); // ???\n\nconst root = createRoot(domNode);\n\nroot.render(<App />);\n\nFor example, if domNode is null, it means that getElementById returned null. This will happen if there is no node in the document with the given ID at the time of your call. There may be a few reasons for it:\n\nThe ID you’re looking for might differ from the ID you used in the HTML file. Check for typos!\nYour bundle’s <script> tag cannot “see” any DOM nodes that appear after it in the HTML.\n\nAnother common way to get this error is to write createRoot(<App />) instead of createRoot(domNode).\n\nI’m getting an error: “Functions are not valid as a React child.” \n\nThis error means that whatever you’re passing to root.render is not a React component.\n\nThis may happen if you call root.render with Component instead of <Component />:\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: App is a function, not a Component.\n\nroot.render(App);\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: <App /> is a component.\n\nroot.render(<App />);\n\nOr if you pass a function to root.render, instead of the result of calling it:\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: createApp is a function, not a component.\n\nroot.render(createApp);\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: call createApp to return a component.\n\nroot.render(createApp());\nMy server-rendered HTML gets re-created from scratch \n\nIf your app is server-rendered and includes the initial HTML generated by React, you might notice that creating a root and calling root.render deletes all that HTML, and then re-creates all the DOM nodes from scratch. This can be slower, resets focus and scroll positions, and may lose other user input.\n\nServer-rendered apps must use hydrateRoot instead of createRoot:\n\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport App from './App.js';\n\n\n\nhydrateRoot(\n\n  document.getElementById('root'),\n\n  <App />\n\n);\n\nNote that its API is different. In particular, usually there will be no further root.render call.\n\nPREVIOUS\nClient APIs\nNEXT\nhydrateRoot"

You should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them.\nIn development mode, React warns about mismatches during hydration. There are no guarantees that attribute differences will be patched up in case of mismatches. This is important for performance reasons because in most apps, mismatches are rare, and so validating all markup would be prohibitively expensive.\nYou’ll likely have only one hydrateRoot call in your app. If you use a framework, it might do this call for you.\nIf your app is client-rendered with no HTML rendered already, using hydrateRoot() is not supported. Use createRoot() instead.\nroot.render(reactNode) \n\nCall root.render to update a React component inside a hydrated React root for a browser DOM element.\n\nroot.render(<App />);\n\nReact will update <App /> in the hydrated root.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \nreactNode: A “React node” that you want to update. This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App />, but you can also pass a React element constructed with createElement(), a string, a number, null, or undefined.\nReturns \n\nroot.render returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \nIf you call root.render before the root has finished hydrating, React will clear the existing server-rendered HTML content and switch the entire root to client rendering.\nroot.unmount() \n\nCall root.unmount to destroy a rendered tree inside a React root.\n\nroot.unmount();\n\nAn app fully built with React will usually not have any calls to root.unmount.\n\nThis is mostly useful if your React root’s DOM node (or any of its ancestors) may get removed from the DOM by some other code. For example, imagine a jQuery tab panel that removes inactive tabs from the DOM. If a tab gets removed, everything inside it (including the React roots inside) would get removed from the DOM as well.

Attempting to call root.render on an unmounted root will throw a “Cannot update an unmounted root” error.\n\nUsage \nHydrating server-rendered HTML \n\nIf your app’s HTML was generated by react-dom/server, you need to hydrate it on the client.\n\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\n\n\nhydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), <App />);\n\nThis will hydrate the server HTML inside the browser DOM node with the React component for your app. Usually, you will do it once at startup. If you use a framework, it might do this behind the scenes for you.\n\nTo hydrate your app, React will “attach” your components’ logic to the initial generated HTML from the server. Hydration turns the initial HTML snapshot from the server into a fully interactive app that runs in the browser.\n\nindex.js\nindex.html\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport './styles.css';\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport App from './App.js';\n\nhydrateRoot(\n  document.getElementById('root'),\n  <App />\n);\n\n\n\nYou shouldn’t need to call hydrateRoot again or to call it in more places. From this point on, React will be managing the DOM of your application. To update the UI, your components will use state instead.\n\nPitfall\n\nThe React tree you pass to hydrateRoot needs to produce the same output as it did on the server.\n\nThis is important for the user experience. The user will spend some time looking at the server-generated HTML before your JavaScript code loads. Server rendering creates an illusion that the app loads faster by showing the HTML snapshot of its output. Suddenly showing different content breaks that illusion. This is why the server render output must match the initial render output on the client.\n\nThe most common causes leading to hydration errors include:\n\nExtra whitespace (like newlines) around the React-generated HTML inside the root node.\nUsing checks like typeof window !== 'undefined' in your rendering logic.\nUsing browser-only APIs like window.matchMedia in your rendering logic.\nRendering different data on the server and the client.\n\nReact recovers from some hydration errors, but you must fix them like other bugs. In the best case, they’ll lead to a slowdown; in the worst case, event handlers can get attached to the wrong elements.\n\nHydrating an entire document \n\nApps fully built with React can render the entire document as JSX, including the <html> tag:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <html>\n\n      <head>\n\n        <meta charSet=\"utf-8\" />\n\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\"></link>\n\n        <title>My app</title>\n\n      </head>\n\n      <body>\n\n        <Router />\n\n      </body>\n\n    </html>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nTo hydrate the entire document, pass the document global as the first argument to hydrateRoot:\n\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport App from './App.js';\n\n\n\nhydrateRoot(document, <App />);\nSuppressing unavoidable hydration mismatch errors \n\nIf a single element’s attribute or text content is unavoidably different between the server and the client (for example, a timestamp), you may silence the hydration mismatch warning.\n\nTo silence hydration warnings on an element, add suppressHydrationWarning={true}:\n\nindex.js\nindex.html\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <h1 suppressHydrationWarning={true}>\n      Current Date: {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}\n    </h1>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThis only works one level deep, and is intended to be an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. React will not attempt to patch mismatched text content.\n\nHandling different client and server content \n\nIf you intentionally need to render something different on the server and the client, you can do a two-pass rendering. Components that render something different on the client can read a state variable like isClient, which you can set to true in an Effect:\n\nindex.js\nindex.html\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setIsClient(true);\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <h1>\n      {isClient ? 'Is Client' : 'Is Server'}\n    </h1>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThis way the initial render pass will render the same content as the server, avoiding mismatches, but an additional pass will happen synchronously right after hydration.\n\nPitfall\n\nThis approach makes hydration slower because your components have to render twice. Be mindful of the user experience on slow connections. The JavaScript code may load significantly later than the initial HTML render, so rendering a different UI immediately after hydration may also feel jarring to the user.\n\nUpdating a hydrated root component \n\nAfter the root has finished hydrating, you can call root.render to update the root React component. Unlike with createRoot, you don’t usually need to do this because the initial content was already rendered as HTML.\n\nIf you call root.render at some point after hydration, and the component tree structure matches up with what was previously rendered, React will preserve the state. Notice how you can type in the input, which means that the updates from repeated render calls every second in this example are not destructive:\n\nindex.js\nindex.html\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport './styles.css';\nimport App from './App.js';\n\nconst root = hydrateRoot(\n  document.getElementById('root'),\n  <App counter={0} />\n);\n\nlet i = 0;\nsetInterval(() => {\n  root.render(<App counter={i} />);\n  i++;\n}, 1000);\n\n\n\nIt is uncommon to call root.render on a hydrated root. Usually, you’ll update state inside one of the components instead.\n\nError logging in production \n\nBy default, React will log all errors to the console. To implement your own error reporting, you can provide the optional error handler root options onUncaughtError, onCaughtError and onRecoverableError:\n\nimport { hydrateRoot } from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nimport App from \"./App.js\";\n\nimport { reportCaughtError } from \"./reportError\";\n\n\n\nconst container = document.getElementById(\"root\");\n\nconst root = hydrateRoot(container, <App />, {\n\n  onCaughtError: (error, errorInfo) => {\n\n    if (error.message !== \"Known error\") {\n\n      reportCaughtError({\n\n        error,\n\n        componentStack: errorInfo.componentStack,\n\n      });\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n});\n\nThe onCaughtError option is a function called with two arguments:\n\nThe error that was thrown.\nAn errorInfo object that contains the componentStack of the error.\n\nTogether with onUncaughtError and onRecoverableError, you can implement your own error reporting system:\n\nindex.js\nreportError.js\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { hydrateRoot } from \"react-dom/client\";\nimport App from \"./App.js\";\nimport {\n  onCaughtErrorProd,\n  onRecoverableErrorProd,\n  onUncaughtErrorProd,\n} from \"./reportError\";\n\nconst container = document.getElementById(\"root\");\nhydrateRoot(container, <App />, {\n  // Keep in mind to remove these options in development to leverage\n  // React's default handlers or implement your own overlay for development.\n  // The handlers are only specfied unconditionally here for demonstration purposes.\n  onCaughtError: onCaughtErrorProd,\n  onRecoverableError: onRecoverableErrorProd,\n  onUncaughtError: onUncaughtErrorProd,\n});\n\n\nShow more\nTroubleshooting \nI’m getting an error: “You passed a second argument to root.render” \n\nA common mistake is to pass the options for hydrateRoot to root.render(...):\n\nConsole\nWarning: You passed a second argument to root.render(…) but it only accepts one argument.\n\nTo fix, pass the root options to hydrateRoot(...), not root.render(...):\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: root.render only takes one argument.\n\nroot.render(App, {onUncaughtError});\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: pass options to createRoot.\n\nconst root = hydrateRoot(container, <App />, {onUncaughtError});\nPREVIOUS\ncreateRoot\nNEXT\nServer APIs"

For example, a JSX element like <App />. It is expected to represent the entire document, so the App component should render the <html> tag.\n\noptional options: An object with streaming options.\n\noptional bootstrapScriptContent: If specified, this string will be placed in an inline <script> tag.\noptional bootstrapScripts: An array of string URLs for the <script> tags to emit on the page. Use this to include the <script> that calls hydrateRoot. Omit it if you don’t want to run React on the client at all.\noptional bootstrapModules: Like bootstrapScripts, but emits <script type=\"module\"> instead.\noptional identifierPrefix: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId. Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as passed to hydrateRoot.\noptional namespaceURI: A string with the root namespace URI for the stream. Defaults to regular HTML. Pass 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' for SVG or 'http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' for MathML.\noptional nonce: A nonce string to allow scripts for script-src Content-Security-Policy.\noptional onAllReady: A callback that fires when all rendering is complete, including both the shell and all additional content. You can use this instead of onShellReady for crawlers and static generation. If you start streaming here, you won’t get any progressive loading. The stream will contain the final HTML.\noptional onError: A callback that fires whenever there is a server error, whether recoverable or not. By default, this only calls console.error. If you override it to log crash reports, make sure that you still call console.error. You can also use it to adjust the status code before the shell is emitted.\noptional onShellReady: A callback that fires right after the initial shell has been rendered. You can set the status code and call pipe here to start streaming. React will stream the additional content after the shell along with the inline <script> tags that replace the HTML loading fallbacks with the content.\noptional onShellError: A callback that fires if there was an error rendering the initial shell. It receives the error as an argument. No bytes were emitted from the stream yet, and neither onShellReady nor onAllReady will get called, so you can output a fallback HTML shell.\noptional progressiveChunkSize: The number of bytes in a chunk. Read more about the default heuristic.\nReturns \n\nrenderToPipeableStream returns an object with two methods:\n\npipe outputs the HTML into the provided Writable Node.js Stream. Call pipe in onShellReady if you want to enable streaming, or in onAllReady for crawlers and static generation.\nabort lets you abort server rendering and render the rest on the client.\nUsage \nRendering a React tree as HTML to a Node.js Stream \n\nCall renderToPipeableStream to render your React tree as HTML into a Node.js Stream:\n\nimport { renderToPipeableStream } from 'react-dom/server';\n\n\n\n// The route handler syntax depends on your backend framework\n\napp.use('/', (request, response) => {\n\n  const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n    onShellReady() {\n\n      response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n      pipe(response);\n\n    }\n\n  });\n\n});\n\nAlong with the root component, you need to provide a list of bootstrap <script> paths. Your root component should return the entire document including the root <html> tag.\n\nFor example, it might look like this:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <html>\n\n      <head>\n\n        <meta charSet=\"utf-8\" />\n\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\"></link>\n\n        <title>My app</title>\n\n      </head>\n\n      <body>\n\n        <Router />\n\n      </body>\n\n    </html>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nReact will inject the doctype and your bootstrap <script> tags into the resulting HTML stream:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html>\n\n  <!-- ... HTML from your components ... -->\n\n</html>\n\n<script src=\"/main.js\" async=\"\"></script>\n\nOn the client, your bootstrap script should hydrate the entire document with a call to hydrateRoot:\n\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport App from './App.js';\n\n\n\nhydrateRoot(document, <App />);\n\nThis will attach event listeners to the server-generated HTML and make it interactive.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nReading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output \nShow Details\nStreaming more content as it loads \n\nStreaming allows the user to start seeing the content even before all the data has loaded on the server. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Sidebar>\n\n        <Friends />\n\n        <Photos />\n\n      </Sidebar>\n\n      <Posts />\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nImagine that loading data for <Posts /> takes some time. Ideally, you’d want to show the rest of the profile page content to the user without waiting for the posts. To do this, wrap Posts in a <Suspense> boundary:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Sidebar>\n\n        <Friends />\n\n        <Photos />\n\n      </Sidebar>\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis tells React to start streaming the HTML before Posts loads its data. React will send the HTML for the loading fallback (PostsGlimmer) first, and then, when Posts finishes loading its data, React will send the remaining HTML along with an inline <script> tag that replaces the loading fallback with that HTML. From the user’s perspective, the page will first appear with the PostsGlimmer, later replaced by the Posts.\n\nYou can further nest <Suspense> boundaries to create a more granular loading sequence:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n\n        <Sidebar>\n\n          <Friends />\n\n          <Photos />\n\n        </Sidebar>\n\n        <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n          <Posts />\n\n        </Suspense>\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn this example, React can start streaming the page even earlier. Only ProfileLayout and ProfileCover must finish rendering first because they are not wrapped in any <Suspense> boundary. However, if Sidebar, Friends, or Photos need to load some data, React will send the HTML for the BigSpinner fallback instead. Then, as more data becomes available, more content will continue to be revealed until all of it becomes visible.\n\nStreaming does not need to wait for React itself to load in the browser, or for your app to become interactive. The HTML content from the server will get progressively revealed before any of the <script> tags load.\n\nRead more about how streaming HTML works.\n\nNote\n\nOnly Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a Promise with use\n\nSuspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.\n\nThe exact way you would load data in the Posts component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.\n\nSuspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.\n\nSpecifying what goes into the shell \n\nThe part of your app outside of any <Suspense> boundaries is called the shell:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n\n        <Sidebar>\n\n          <Friends />\n\n          <Photos />\n\n        </Sidebar>\n\n        <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n          <Posts />\n\n        </Suspense>\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIt determines the earliest loading state that the user may see:\n\n<ProfileLayout>\n\n  <ProfileCover />\n\n  <BigSpinner />\n\n</ProfileLayout>\n\nIf you wrap the whole app into a <Suspense> boundary at the root, the shell will only contain that spinner. However, that’s not a pleasant user experience because seeing a big spinner on the screen can feel slower and more annoying than waiting a bit more and seeing the real layout. This is why usually you’ll want to place the <Suspense> boundaries so that the shell feels minimal but complete—like a skeleton of the entire page layout.\n\nThe onShellReady callback fires when the entire shell has been rendered. Usually, you’ll start streaming then:\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    pipe(response);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nBy the time onShellReady fires, components in nested <Suspense> boundaries might still be loading data.\n\nLogging crashes on the server \n\nBy default, all errors on the server are logged to console. You can override this behavior to log crash reports:\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    pipe(response);\n\n  },\n\n  onError(error) {\n\n    console.error(error);\n\n    logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nIf you provide a custom onError implementation, don’t forget to also log errors to the console like above.\n\nRecovering from errors inside the shell \n\nIn this example, the shell contains ProfileLayout, ProfileCover, and PostsGlimmer:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIf an error occurs while rendering those components, React won’t have any meaningful HTML to send to the client. Override onShellError to send a fallback HTML that doesn’t rely on server rendering as the last resort:\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    pipe(response);\n\n  },\n\n  onShellError(error) {\n\n    response.statusCode = 500;\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); \n\n  },\n\n  onError(error) {\n\n    console.error(error);\n\n    logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nIf there is an error while generating the shell, both onError and onShellError will fire. Use onError for error reporting and use onShellError to send the fallback HTML document. Your fallback HTML does not have to be an error page. Instead, you may include an alternative shell that renders your app on the client only.\n\nRecovering from errors outside the shell \n\nIn this example, the <Posts /> component is wrapped in <Suspense> so it is not a part of the shell:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIf an error happens in the Posts component or somewhere inside it, React will try to recover from it:\n\nIt will emit the loading fallback for the closest <Suspense> boundary (PostsGlimmer) into the HTML.\nIt will “give up” on trying to render the Posts content on the server anymore.\nWhen the JavaScript code loads on the client, React will retry rendering Posts on the client.\n\nIf retrying rendering Posts on the client also fails, React will throw the error on the client. As with all the errors thrown during rendering, the closest parent error boundary determines how to present the error to the user. In practice, this means that the user will see a loading indicator until it is certain that the error is not recoverable.\n\nIf retrying rendering Posts on the client succeeds, the loading fallback from the server will be replaced with the client rendering output. The user will not know that there was a server error. However, the server onError callback and the client onRecoverableError callbacks will fire so that you can get notified about the error.\n\nSetting the status code \n\nStreaming introduces a tradeoff. You want to start streaming the page as early as possible so that the user can see the content sooner. However, once you start streaming, you can no longer set the response status code.\n\nBy dividing your app into the shell (above all <Suspense> boundaries) and the rest of the content, you’ve already solved a part of this problem. If the shell errors, you’ll get the onShellError callback which lets you set the error status code. Otherwise, you know that the app may recover on the client, so you can send “OK”.\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    response.statusCode = 200;\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    pipe(response);\n\n  },\n\n  onShellError(error) {\n\n    response.statusCode = 500;\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); \n\n  },\n\n  onError(error) {\n\n    console.error(error);\n\n    logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nIf a component outside the shell (i.e. inside a <Suspense> boundary) throws an error, React will not stop rendering. This means that the onError callback will fire, but you will still get onShellReady instead of onShellError. This is because React will try to recover from that error on the client, as described above.\n\nHowever, if you’d like, you can use the fact that something has errored to set the status code:\n\nlet didError = false;\n\n\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    response.statusCode = didError ? 500 : 200;\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    pipe(response);\n\n  },\n\n  onShellError(error) {\n\n    response.statusCode = 500;\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); \n\n  },\n\n  onError(error) {\n\n    didError = true;\n\n    console.error(error);\n\n    logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nThis will only catch errors outside the shell that happened while generating the initial shell content, so it’s not exhaustive. If knowing whether an error occurred for some content is critical, you can move it up into the shell.\n\nHandling different errors in different ways \n\nYou can create your own Error subclasses and use the instanceof operator to check which error is thrown. For example, you can define a custom NotFoundError and throw it from your component. Then your onError, onShellReady, and onShellError callbacks can do something different depending on the error type:\n\nlet didError = false;\n\nlet caughtError = null;\n\n\n\nfunction getStatusCode() {\n\n  if (didError) {\n\n    if (caughtError instanceof NotFoundError) {\n\n      return 404;\n\n    } else {\n\n      return 500;\n\n    }\n\n  } else {\n\n    return 200;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    response.statusCode = getStatusCode();\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    pipe(response);\n\n  },\n\n  onShellError(error) {\n\n   response.statusCode = getStatusCode();\n\n   response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n   response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); \n\n  },\n\n  onError(error) {\n\n    didError = true;\n\n    caughtError = error;\n\n    console.error(error);\n\n    logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nKeep in mind that once you emit the shell and start streaming, you can’t change the status code.\n\nWaiting for all content to load for crawlers and static generation \n\nStreaming offers a better user experience because the user can see the content as it becomes available.\n\nHowever, when a crawler visits your page, or if you’re generating the pages at the build time, you might want to let all of the content load first and then produce the final HTML output instead of revealing it progressively.\n\nYou can wait for all the content to load using the onAllReady callback:\n\nlet didError = false;\n\nlet isCrawler = // ... depends on your bot detection strategy ...\n\n\n\nconst { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n  onShellReady() {\n\n    if (!isCrawler) {\n\n      response.statusCode = didError ? 500 : 200;\n\n      response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n      pipe(response);\n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  onShellError(error) {\n\n    response.statusCode = 500;\n\n    response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n    response.send('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>'); \n\n  },\n\n  onAllReady() {\n\n    if (isCrawler) {\n\n      response.statusCode = didError ? 500 : 200;\n\n      response.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');\n\n      pipe(response);      \n\n    }\n\n  },\n\n  onError(error) {\n\n    didError = true;\n\n    console.error(error);\n\n    logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n  }\n\n});\n\nA regular visitor will get a stream of progressively loaded content. A crawler will receive the final HTML output after all the data loads. However, this also means that the crawler will have to wait for all data, some of which might be slow to load or error. Depending on your app, you could choose to send the shell to the crawlers too.\n\nAborting server rendering \n\nYou can force the server rendering to “give up” after a timeout:\n\nconst { pipe, abort } = renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\n\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n\n  abort();\n\n}, 10000);\n\nReact will flush the remaining loading fallbacks as HTML, and will attempt to render the rest on the client.\n\nPREVIOUS\nServer APIs\nNEXT\nrenderToReadableStream"

For Node.js, use renderToPipeableStream instead.\n\nReference \nrenderToReadableStream(reactNode, options?) \n\nCall renderToReadableStream to render your React tree as HTML into a Readable Web Stream.\n\nimport { renderToReadableStream } from 'react-dom/server';\n\n\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']\n\n  });\n\n  return new Response(stream, {\n\n    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n  });\n\n}\n\nOn the client, call hydrateRoot to make the server-generated HTML interactive.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nreactNode: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX element like <App />. It is expected to represent the entire document, so the App component should render the <html> tag.\n\noptional options: An object with streaming options.\n\noptional bootstrapScriptContent: If specified, this string will be placed in an inline <script> tag.\noptional bootstrapScripts: An array of string URLs for the <script> tags to emit on the page. Use this to include the <script> that calls hydrateRoot. Omit it if you don’t want to run React on the client at all.\noptional bootstrapModules: Like bootstrapScripts, but emits <script type=\"module\"> instead.\noptional identifierPrefix: A string prefix React uses for IDs generated by useId. Useful to avoid conflicts when using multiple roots on the same page. Must be the same prefix as passed to hydrateRoot.\noptional namespaceURI: A string with the root namespace URI for the stream. Defaults to regular HTML. Pass 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' for SVG or 'http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' for MathML.\noptional nonce: A nonce string to allow scripts for script-src Content-Security-Policy.\noptional onError: A callback that fires whenever there is a server error, whether recoverable or not. By default, this only calls console.error. If you override it to log crash reports, make sure that you still call console.error. You can also use it to adjust the status code before the shell is emitted.\noptional progressiveChunkSize: The number of bytes in a chunk. Read more about the default heuristic.\noptional signal: An abort signal that lets you abort server rendering and render the rest on the client.\nReturns \n\nrenderToReadableStream returns a Promise:\n\nIf rendering the shell is successful, that Promise will resolve to a Readable Web Stream.\nIf rendering the shell fails, the Promise will be rejected. Use this to output a fallback shell.\n\nThe returned stream has an additional property:\n\nallReady: A Promise that resolves when all rendering is complete, including both the shell and all additional content. You can await stream.allReady before returning a response for crawlers and static generation. If you do that, you won’t get any progressive loading. The stream will contain the final HTML.\nUsage \nRendering a React tree as HTML to a Readable Web Stream \n\nCall renderToReadableStream to render your React tree as HTML into a Readable Web Stream:\n\nimport { renderToReadableStream } from 'react-dom/server';\n\n\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']\n\n  });\n\n  return new Response(stream, {\n\n    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n  });\n\n}\n\nAlong with the root component, you need to provide a list of bootstrap <script> paths. Your root component should return the entire document including the root <html> tag.\n\nFor example, it might look like this:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <html>\n\n      <head>\n\n        <meta charSet=\"utf-8\" />\n\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\"></link>\n\n        <title>My app</title>\n\n      </head>\n\n      <body>\n\n        <Router />\n\n      </body>\n\n    </html>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nReact will inject the doctype and your bootstrap <script> tags into the resulting HTML stream:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html>\n\n  <!-- ... HTML from your components ... -->\n\n</html>\n\n<script src=\"/main.js\" async=\"\"></script>\n\nOn the client, your bootstrap script should hydrate the entire document with a call to hydrateRoot:\n\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport App from './App.js';\n\n\n\nhydrateRoot(document, <App />);\n\nThis will attach event listeners to the server-generated HTML and make it interactive.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nReading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output \nShow Details\nStreaming more content as it loads \n\nStreaming allows the user to start seeing the content even before all the data has loaded on the server. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Sidebar>\n\n        <Friends />\n\n        <Photos />\n\n      </Sidebar>\n\n      <Posts />\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nImagine that loading data for <Posts /> takes some time. Ideally, you’d want to show the rest of the profile page content to the user without waiting for the posts. To do this, wrap Posts in a <Suspense> boundary:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Sidebar>\n\n        <Friends />\n\n        <Photos />\n\n      </Sidebar>\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis tells React to start streaming the HTML before Posts loads its data. React will send the HTML for the loading fallback (PostsGlimmer) first, and then, when Posts finishes loading its data, React will send the remaining HTML along with an inline <script> tag that replaces the loading fallback with that HTML. From the user’s perspective, the page will first appear with the PostsGlimmer, later replaced by the Posts.\n\nYou can further nest <Suspense> boundaries to create a more granular loading sequence:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n\n        <Sidebar>\n\n          <Friends />\n\n          <Photos />\n\n        </Sidebar>\n\n        <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n          <Posts />\n\n        </Suspense>\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn this example, React can start streaming the page even earlier. Only ProfileLayout and ProfileCover must finish rendering first because they are not wrapped in any <Suspense> boundary. However, if Sidebar, Friends, or Photos need to load some data, React will send the HTML for the BigSpinner fallback instead. Then, as more data becomes available, more content will continue to be revealed until all of it becomes visible.\n\nStreaming does not need to wait for React itself to load in the browser, or for your app to become interactive. The HTML content from the server will get progressively revealed before any of the <script> tags load.\n\nRead more about how streaming HTML works.\n\nNote\n\nOnly Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a Promise with use\n\nSuspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.\n\nThe exact way you would load data in the Posts component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.\n\nSuspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.\n\nSpecifying what goes into the shell \n\nThe part of your app outside of any <Suspense> boundaries is called the shell:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n\n        <Sidebar>\n\n          <Friends />\n\n          <Photos />\n\n        </Sidebar>\n\n        <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n          <Posts />\n\n        </Suspense>\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIt determines the earliest loading state that the user may see:\n\n<ProfileLayout>\n\n  <ProfileCover />\n\n  <BigSpinner />\n\n</ProfileLayout>\n\nIf you wrap the whole app into a <Suspense> boundary at the root, the shell will only contain that spinner. However, that’s not a pleasant user experience because seeing a big spinner on the screen can feel slower and more annoying than waiting a bit more and seeing the real layout. This is why usually you’ll want to place the <Suspense> boundaries so that the shell feels minimal but complete—like a skeleton of the entire page layout.\n\nThe async call to renderToReadableStream will resolve to a stream as soon as the entire shell has been rendered. Usually, you’ll start streaming then by creating and returning a response with that stream:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']\n\n  });\n\n  return new Response(stream, {\n\n    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n  });\n\n}\n\nBy the time the stream is returned, components in nested <Suspense> boundaries might still be loading data.\n\nLogging crashes on the server \n\nBy default, all errors on the server are logged to console. You can override this behavior to log crash reports:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n    onError(error) {\n\n      console.error(error);\n\n      logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n    }\n\n  });\n\n  return new Response(stream, {\n\n    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n  });\n\n}\n\nIf you provide a custom onError implementation, don’t forget to also log errors to the console like above.\n\nRecovering from errors inside the shell \n\nIn this example, the shell contains ProfileLayout, ProfileCover, and PostsGlimmer:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIf an error occurs while rendering those components, React won’t have any meaningful HTML to send to the client. Wrap your renderToReadableStream call in a try...catch to send a fallback HTML that doesn’t rely on server rendering as the last resort:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  try {\n\n    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n      onError(error) {\n\n        console.error(error);\n\n        logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    return new Response(stream, {\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  } catch (error) {\n\n    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {\n\n      status: 500,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nIf there is an error while generating the shell, both onError and your catch block will fire. Use onError for error reporting and use the catch block to send the fallback HTML document. Your fallback HTML does not have to be an error page. Instead, you may include an alternative shell that renders your app on the client only.\n\nRecovering from errors outside the shell \n\nIn this example, the <Posts /> component is wrapped in <Suspense> so it is not a part of the shell:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIf an error happens in the Posts component or somewhere inside it, React will try to recover from it:\n\nIt will emit the loading fallback for the closest <Suspense> boundary (PostsGlimmer) into the HTML.\nIt will “give up” on trying to render the Posts content on the server anymore.\nWhen the JavaScript code loads on the client, React will retry rendering Posts on the client.\n\nIf retrying rendering Posts on the client also fails, React will throw the error on the client. As with all the errors thrown during rendering, the closest parent error boundary determines how to present the error to the user. In practice, this means that the user will see a loading indicator until it is certain that the error is not recoverable.\n\nIf retrying rendering Posts on the client succeeds, the loading fallback from the server will be replaced with the client rendering output. The user will not know that there was a server error. However, the server onError callback and the client onRecoverableError callbacks will fire so that you can get notified about the error.\n\nSetting the status code \n\nStreaming introduces a tradeoff. You want to start streaming the page as early as possible so that the user can see the content sooner. However, once you start streaming, you can no longer set the response status code.\n\nBy dividing your app into the shell (above all <Suspense> boundaries) and the rest of the content, you’ve already solved a part of this problem. If the shell errors, your catch block will run which lets you set the error status code. Otherwise, you know that the app may recover on the client, so you can send “OK”.\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  try {\n\n    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n      onError(error) {\n\n        console.error(error);\n\n        logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    return new Response(stream, {\n\n      status: 200,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  } catch (error) {\n\n    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {\n\n      status: 500,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nIf a component outside the shell (i.e. inside a <Suspense> boundary) throws an error, React will not stop rendering. This means that the onError callback will fire, but your code will continue running without getting into the catch block. This is because React will try to recover from that error on the client, as described above.\n\nHowever, if you’d like, you can use the fact that something has errored to set the status code:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  try {\n\n    let didError = false;\n\n    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n      onError(error) {\n\n        didError = true;\n\n        console.error(error);\n\n        logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    return new Response(stream, {\n\n      status: didError ? 500 : 200,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  } catch (error) {\n\n    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {\n\n      status: 500,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nThis will only catch errors outside the shell that happened while generating the initial shell content, so it’s not exhaustive. If knowing whether an error occurred for some content is critical, you can move it up into the shell.\n\nHandling different errors in different ways \n\nYou can create your own Error subclasses and use the instanceof operator to check which error is thrown. For example, you can define a custom NotFoundError and throw it from your component. Then you can save the error in onError and do something different before returning the response depending on the error type:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  let didError = false;\n\n  let caughtError = null;\n\n\n\n  function getStatusCode() {\n\n    if (didError) {\n\n      if (caughtError instanceof NotFoundError) {\n\n        return 404;\n\n      } else {\n\n        return 500;\n\n      }\n\n    } else {\n\n      return 200;\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  try {\n\n    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n      onError(error) {\n\n        didError = true;\n\n        caughtError = error;\n\n        console.error(error);\n\n        logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    return new Response(stream, {\n\n      status: getStatusCode(),\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  } catch (error) {\n\n    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {\n\n      status: getStatusCode(),\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nKeep in mind that once you emit the shell and start streaming, you can’t change the status code.\n\nWaiting for all content to load for crawlers and static generation \n\nStreaming offers a better user experience because the user can see the content as it becomes available.\n\nHowever, when a crawler visits your page, or if you’re generating the pages at the build time, you might want to let all of the content load first and then produce the final HTML output instead of revealing it progressively.\n\nYou can wait for all the content to load by awaiting the stream.allReady Promise:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  try {\n\n    let didError = false;\n\n    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n      onError(error) {\n\n        didError = true;\n\n        console.error(error);\n\n        logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    let isCrawler = // ... depends on your bot detection strategy ...\n\n    if (isCrawler) {\n\n      await stream.allReady;\n\n    }\n\n    return new Response(stream, {\n\n      status: didError ? 500 : 200,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  } catch (error) {\n\n    return new Response('<h1>Something went wrong</h1>', {\n\n      status: 500,\n\n      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nA regular visitor will get a stream of progressively loaded content. A crawler will receive the final HTML output after all the data loads. However, this also means that the crawler will have to wait for all data, some of which might be slow to load or error. Depending on your app, you could choose to send the shell to the crawlers too.\n\nAborting server rendering \n\nYou can force the server rendering to “give up” after a timeout:\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  try {\n\n    const controller = new AbortController();\n\n    setTimeout(() => {\n\n      controller.abort();\n\n    }, 10000);\n\n\n\n    const stream = await renderToReadableStream(<App />, {\n\n      signal: controller.signal,\n\n      bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js'],\n\n      onError(error) {\n\n        didError = true;\n\n        console.error(error);\n\n        logServerCrashReport(error);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    // ...\n\nReact will flush the remaining loading fallbacks as HTML, and will attempt to render the rest on the client.\n\nPREVIOUS\nrenderToPipeableStream\nNEXT\nrenderToStaticMarkup"

Instead, renderToString will find the closest <Suspense> boundary above it and render its fallback prop in the HTML. The content will not appear until the client code loads.\n\nTo solve this, use one of the recommended streaming solutions. For server side rendering, they can stream content in chunks as it resolves on the server so that the user sees the page being progressively filled in before the client code loads. For static site generation, they can wait for all the content to resolve before generating the static HTML.\n\nPREVIOUS\nrenderToStaticMarkup\nNEXT\nresume"

Nonces must be unique per request and if you use nonces to secure your application with CSP it would be inappropriate and insecure to include the nonce value in the prerender itself.\n\nNote\nWhen should I use prerender? \n\nThe static prerender API is used for static server-side generation (SSG). Unlike renderToString, prerender waits for all data to load before resolving. This makes it suitable for generating static HTML for a full page, including data that needs to be fetched using Suspense. To stream content as it loads, use a streaming server-side render (SSR) API like renderToReadableStream.\n\nprerender can be aborted and later either continued with resumeAndPrerender or resumed with resume to support partial pre-rendering.\n\nUsage \nRendering a React tree to a stream of static HTML \n\nCall prerender to render your React tree to static HTML into a Readable Web Stream::\n\nimport { prerender } from 'react-dom/static';\n\n\n\nasync function handler(request) {\n\n  const {prelude} = await prerender(<App />, {\n\n    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']\n\n  });\n\n  return new Response(prelude, {\n\n    headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },\n\n  });\n\n}\n\nAlong with the root component, you need to provide a list of bootstrap <script> paths. Your root component should return the entire document including the root <html> tag.\n\nFor example, it might look like this:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <html>\n\n      <head>\n\n        <meta charSet=\"utf-8\" />\n\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles.css\"></link>\n\n        <title>My app</title>\n\n      </head>\n\n      <body>\n\n        <Router />\n\n      </body>\n\n    </html>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nReact will inject the doctype and your bootstrap <script> tags into the resulting HTML stream:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html>\n\n  <!-- ... HTML from your components ... -->\n\n</html>\n\n<script src=\"/main.js\" async=\"\"></script>\n\nOn the client, your bootstrap script should hydrate the entire document with a call to hydrateRoot:\n\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport App from './App.js';\n\n\n\nhydrateRoot(document, <App />);\n\nThis will attach event listeners to the static server-generated HTML and make it interactive.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nReading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output \nShow Details\nRendering a React tree to a string of static HTML \n\nCall prerender to render your app to a static HTML string:\n\nimport { prerender } from 'react-dom/static';\n\n\n\nasync function renderToString() {\n\n  const {prelude} = await prerender(<App />, {\n\n    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  const reader = prelude.getReader();\n\n  let content = '';\n\n  while (true) {\n\n    const {done, value} = await reader.read();\n\n    if (done) {\n\n      return content;\n\n    }\n\n    content += Buffer.from(value).toString('utf8');\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nThis will produce the initial non-interactive HTML output of your React components. On the client, you will need to call hydrateRoot to hydrate that server-generated HTML and make it interactive.\n\nWaiting for all data to load \n\nprerender waits for all data to load before finishing the static HTML generation and resolving. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Sidebar>\n\n        <Friends />\n\n        <Photos />\n\n      </Sidebar>\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nImagine that <Posts /> needs to load some data, which takes some time. Ideally, you’d want wait for the posts to finish so it’s included in the HTML. To do this, you can use Suspense to suspend on the data, and prerender will wait for the suspended content to finish before resolving to the static HTML.\n\nNote\n\nOnly Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a Promise with use\n\nSuspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.\n\nThe exact way you would load data in the Posts component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.\n\nSuspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.\n\nAborting prerendering \n\nYou can force the prerender to “give up” after a timeout:\n\nasync function renderToString() {\n\n  const controller = new AbortController();\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    controller.abort()\n\n  }, 10000);\n\n\n\n  try {\n\n    // the prelude will contain all the HTML that was prerendered\n\n    // before the controller aborted.\n\n    const {prelude} = await prerender(<App />, {\n\n      signal: controller.signal,\n\n    });\n\n    //...\n\nAny Suspense boundaries with incomplete children will be included in the prelude in the fallback state.\n\nThis can be used for partial prerendering together with resume or resumeAndPrerender.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy stream doesn’t start until the entire app is rendered \n\nThe prerender response waits for the entire app to finish rendering, including waiting for all Suspense boundaries to resolve, before resolving. It is designed for static site generation (SSG) ahead of time and does not support streaming more content as it loads.\n\nTo stream content as it loads, use a streaming server render API like renderToReadableStream.\n\nPREVIOUS\nStatic APIs\nNEXT\nprerenderToNodeStream"

HTML from your components ... -->\n\n</html>\n\n<script src=\"/main.js\" async=\"\"></script>\n\nOn the client, your bootstrap script should hydrate the entire document with a call to hydrateRoot:\n\nimport { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport App from './App.js';\n\n\n\nhydrateRoot(document, <App />);\n\nThis will attach event listeners to the static server-generated HTML and make it interactive.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nReading CSS and JS asset paths from the build output \nShow Details\nRendering a React tree to a string of static HTML \n\nCall prerenderToNodeStream to render your app to a static HTML string:\n\nimport { prerenderToNodeStream } from 'react-dom/static';\n\n\n\nasync function renderToString() {\n\n  const {prelude} = await prerenderToNodeStream(<App />, {\n\n    bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n\n    let data = '';\n\n    prelude.on('data', chunk => {\n\n      data += chunk;\n\n    });\n\n    prelude.on('end', () => resolve(data));\n\n    prelude.on('error', reject);\n\n  });\n\n}\n\nThis will produce the initial non-interactive HTML output of your React components. On the client, you will need to call hydrateRoot to hydrate that server-generated HTML and make it interactive.\n\nWaiting for all data to load \n\nprerenderToNodeStream waits for all data to load before finishing the static HTML generation and resolving. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts:\n\nfunction ProfilePage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ProfileLayout>\n\n      <ProfileCover />\n\n      <Sidebar>\n\n        <Friends />\n\n        <Photos />\n\n      </Sidebar>\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<PostsGlimmer />}>\n\n        <Posts />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </ProfileLayout>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nImagine that <Posts /> needs to load some data, which takes some time. Ideally, you’d want wait for the posts to finish so it’s included in the HTML. To do this, you can use Suspense to suspend on the data, and prerenderToNodeStream will wait for the suspended content to finish before resolving to the static HTML.\n\nNote\n\nOnly Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a Promise with use\n\nSuspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.\n\nThe exact way you would load data in the Posts component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.\n\nSuspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.\n\nAborting prerendering \n\nYou can force the prerender to “give up” after a timeout:\n\nasync function renderToString() {\n\n  const controller = new AbortController();\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    controller.abort()\n\n  }, 10000);\n\n\n\n  try {\n\n    // the prelude will contain all the HTML that was prerendered\n\n    // before the controller aborted.\n\n    const {prelude} = await prerenderToNodeStream(<App />, {\n\n      signal: controller.signal,\n\n    });\n\n    //...\n\nAny Suspense boundaries with incomplete children will be included in the prelude in the fallback state.\n\nThis can be used for partial prerendering together with resumeToPipeableStream or resumeAndPrerenderToNodeStream.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy stream doesn’t start until the entire app is rendered \n\nThe prerenderToNodeStream response waits for the entire app to finish rendering, including waiting for all Suspense boundaries to resolve, before resolving. It is designed for static site generation (SSG) ahead of time and does not support streaming more content as it loads.\n\nTo stream content as it loads, use a streaming server render API like renderToPipeableStream.\n\nPREVIOUS\nprerender\nNEXT\nresumeAndPrerender"

If omitted, it’s undefined.\nReturns \n\nIf children is null or undefined, returns the same value.\n\nOtherwise, returns a flat array consisting of the nodes you’ve returned from the fn function. The returned array will contain all nodes you returned except for null and undefined.\n\nCaveats \n\nEmpty nodes (null, undefined, and Booleans), strings, numbers, and React elements count as individual nodes. Arrays don’t count as individual nodes, but their children do. The traversal does not go deeper than React elements: they don’t get rendered, and their children aren’t traversed. Fragments don’t get traversed.\n\nIf you return an element or an array of elements with keys from fn, the returned elements’ keys will be automatically combined with the key of the corresponding original item from children. When you return multiple elements from fn in an array, their keys only need to be unique locally amongst each other.\n\nChildren.only(children) \n\nCall Children.only(children) to assert that children represent a single React element.\n\nfunction Box({ children }) {\n\n  const element = Children.only(children);\n\n  // ...\nParameters \nchildren: The value of the children prop received by your component.\nReturns \n\nIf children is a valid element, returns that element.\n\nOtherwise, throws an error.\n\nCaveats \nThis method always throws if you pass an array (such as the return value of Children.map) as children.

The returned elements’ keys will be calculated from the original elements’ keys and their level of nesting and position. This ensures that flattening the array does not introduce changes in behavior.\nUsage \nTransforming children \n\nTo transform the children JSX that your component receives as the children prop, call Children.map:\n\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction RowList({ children }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"RowList\">\n\n      {Children.map(children, child =>\n\n        <div className=\"Row\">\n\n          {child}\n\n        </div>\n\n      )}\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn the example above, the RowList wraps every child it receives into a <div className=\"Row\"> container. For example, let’s say the parent component passes three <p> tags as the children prop to RowList:\n\n<RowList>\n\n  <p>This is the first item.</p>\n\n  <p>This is the second item.</p>\n\n  <p>This is the third item.</p>\n\n</RowList>\n\nThen, with the RowList implementation above, the final rendered result will look like this:\n\n<div className=\"RowList\">\n\n  <div className=\"Row\">\n\n    <p>This is the first item.</p>\n\n  </div>\n\n  <div className=\"Row\">\n\n    <p>This is the second item.</p>\n\n  </div>\n\n  <div className=\"Row\">\n\n    <p>This is the third item.</p>\n\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n\nChildren.map is similar to to transforming arrays with map(). The difference is that the children data structure is considered opaque. This means that even if it’s sometimes an array, you should not assume it’s an array or any other particular data type. This is why you should use Children.map if you need to transform it.\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\nexport default function RowList({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"RowList\">\n      {Children.map(children, child =>\n        <div className=\"Row\">\n          {child}\n        </div>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhy is the children prop not always an array? \nShow Details\nPitfall\n\nThe children data structure does not include rendered output of the components you pass as JSX. In the example below, the children received by the RowList only contains two items rather than three:\n\n<p>This is the first item.</p>\n<MoreRows />\n\nThis is why only two row wrappers are generated in this example:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport RowList from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList>\n      <p>This is the first item.</p>\n      <MoreRows />\n    </RowList>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction MoreRows() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <p>This is the second item.</p>\n      <p>This is the third item.</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThere is no way to get the rendered output of an inner component like <MoreRows /> when manipulating children.

This is why it’s usually better to use one of the alternative solutions.\n\nConverting children to an array \n\nCall Children.toArray(children) to turn the children data structure into a regular JavaScript array. This lets you manipulate the array with built-in array methods like filter, sort, or reverse.\n\nApp.js\nReversedList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\nexport default function ReversedList({ children }) {\n  const result = Children.toArray(children);\n  result.reverse();\n  return result;\n}\n\n\nPitfall\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there is no way to get the rendered output of an inner component when manipulating children. This is why it’s usually better to use one of the alternative solutions.\n\nAlternatives \nNote\n\nThis section describes alternatives to the Children API (with capital C) that’s imported like this:\n\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\nDon’t confuse it with using the children prop (lowercase c), which is good and encouraged.\n\nExposing multiple components \n\nManipulating children with the Children methods often leads to fragile code. When you pass children to a component in JSX, you don’t usually expect the component to manipulate or transform the individual children.\n\nWhen you can, try to avoid using the Children methods. For example, if you want every child of RowList to be wrapped in <div className=\"Row\">, export a Row component, and manually wrap every row into it like this:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the first item.</p>\n      </Row>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the second item.</p>\n      </Row>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the third item.</p>\n      </Row>\n    </RowList>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nUnlike using Children.map, this approach does not wrap every child automatically. However, this approach has a significant benefit compared to the earlier example with Children.map because it works even if you keep extracting more components. For example, it still works if you extract your own MoreRows component:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the first item.</p>\n      </Row>\n      <MoreRows />\n    </RowList>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction MoreRows() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the second item.</p>\n      </Row>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the third item.</p>\n      </Row>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis wouldn’t work with Children.map because it would “see” <MoreRows /> as a single child (and a single row).\n\nAccepting an array of objects as a prop \n\nYou can also explicitly pass an array as a prop. For example, this RowList accepts a rows array as a prop:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList rows={[\n      { id: 'first', content: <p>This is the first item.</p> },\n      { id: 'second', content: <p>This is the second item.</p> },\n      { id: 'third', content: <p>This is the third item.</p> }\n    ]} />\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nSince rows is a regular JavaScript array, the RowList component can use built-in array methods like map on it.\n\nThis pattern is especially useful when you want to be able to pass more information as structured data together with children. In the below example, the TabSwitcher component receives an array of objects as the tabs prop:\n\nApp.js\nTabSwitcher.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport TabSwitcher from './TabSwitcher.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <TabSwitcher tabs={[\n      {\n        id: 'first',\n        header: 'First',\n        content: <p>This is the first item.</p>\n      },\n      {\n        id: 'second',\n        header: 'Second',\n        content: <p>This is the second item.</p>\n      },\n      {\n        id: 'third',\n        header: 'Third',\n        content: <p>This is the third item.</p>\n      }\n    ]} />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nUnlike passing the children as JSX, this approach lets you associate some extra data like header with each item. Because you are working with the tabs directly, and it is an array, you do not need the Children methods.\n\nCalling a render prop to customize rendering \n\nInstead of producing JSX for every single item, you can also pass a function that returns JSX, and call that function when necessary. In this example, the App component passes a renderContent function to the TabSwitcher component. The TabSwitcher component calls renderContent only for the selected tab:\n\nApp.js\nTabSwitcher.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport TabSwitcher from './TabSwitcher.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <TabSwitcher\n      tabIds={['first', 'second', 'third']}\n      getHeader={tabId => {\n        return tabId[0].toUpperCase() + tabId.slice(1);\n      }}\n      renderContent={tabId => {\n        return <p>This is the {tabId} item.</p>;\n      }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nA prop like renderContent is called a render prop because it is a prop that specifies how to render a piece of the user interface. However, there is nothing special about it: it is a regular prop which happens to be a function.\n\nRender props are functions, so you can pass information to them. For example, this RowList component passes the id and the index of each row to the renderRow render prop, which uses index to highlight even rows:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList\n      rowIds={['first', 'second', 'third']}\n      renderRow={(id, index) => {\n        return (\n          <Row isHighlighted={index % 2 === 0}>\n            <p>This is the {id} item.</p>\n          </Row> \n        );\n      }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis is another example of how parent and child components can cooperate without manipulating the children.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI pass a custom component, but the Children methods don’t show its render result \n\nSuppose you pass two children to RowList like this:\n\n<RowList>\n\n  <p>First item</p>\n\n  <MoreRows />\n\n</RowList>\n\nIf you do Children.count(children) inside RowList, you will get 2. Even if MoreRows renders 10 different items, or if it returns null, Children.count(children) will still be 2. From the RowList’s perspective, it only “sees” the JSX it has received. It does not “see” the internals of the MoreRows component.\n\nThe limitation makes it hard to extract a component. This is why alternatives are preferred to using Children.\n\nPREVIOUS\nLegacy React APIs\nNEXT\ncloneElement"

See common alternatives.\n\ncloneElement lets you create a new React element using another element as a starting point.\n\nconst clonedElement = cloneElement(element, props, ...children)\nReference\ncloneElement(element, props, ...children)\nUsage\nOverriding props of an element\nAlternatives\nPassing data with a render prop\nPassing data through context\nExtracting logic into a custom Hook\nReference \ncloneElement(element, props, ...children) \n\nCall cloneElement to create a React element based on the element, but with different props and children:\n\nimport { cloneElement } from 'react';\n\n\n\n// ...\n\nconst clonedElement = cloneElement(\n\n  <Row title=\"Cabbage\">\n\n    Hello\n\n  </Row>,\n\n  { isHighlighted: true },\n\n  'Goodbye'\n\n);\n\n\n\nconsole.log(clonedElement); // <Row title=\"Cabbage\" isHighlighted={true}>Goodbye</Row>\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nelement: The element argument must be a valid React element. For example, it could be a JSX node like <Something />, the result of calling createElement, or the result of another cloneElement call.\n\nprops: The props argument must either be an object or null. If you pass null, the cloned element will retain all of the original element.props. Otherwise, for every prop in the props object, the returned element will “prefer” the value from props over the value from element.props. The rest of the props will be filled from the original element.props. If you pass props.key or props.ref, they will replace the original ones.\n\noptional ...children: Zero or more child nodes. They can be any React nodes, including React elements, strings, numbers, portals, empty nodes (null, undefined, true, and false), and arrays of React nodes. If you don’t pass any ...children arguments, the original element.props.children will be preserved.\n\nReturns \n\ncloneElement returns a React element object with a few properties:\n\ntype: Same as element.type.\nprops: The result of shallowly merging element.props with the overriding props you have passed.\nref: The original element.ref, unless it was overridden by props.ref.\nkey: The original element.key, unless it was overridden by props.key.\n\nUsually, you’ll return the element from your component or make it a child of another element. Although you may read the element’s properties, it’s best to treat every element as opaque after it’s created, and only render it.\n\nCaveats \n\nCloning an element does not modify the original element.\n\nYou should only pass children as multiple arguments to cloneElement if they are all statically known, like cloneElement(element, null, child1, child2, child3). If your children are dynamic, pass the entire array as the third argument: cloneElement(element, null, listItems). This ensures that React will warn you about missing keys for any dynamic lists. For static lists this is not necessary because they never reorder.\n\ncloneElement makes it harder to trace the data flow, so try the alternatives instead.\n\nUsage \nOverriding props of an element \n\nTo override the props of some React element, pass it to cloneElement with the props you want to override:\n\nimport { cloneElement } from 'react';\n\n\n\n// ...\n\nconst clonedElement = cloneElement(\n\n  <Row title=\"Cabbage\" />,\n\n  { isHighlighted: true }\n\n);\n\nHere, the resulting cloned element will be <Row title=\"Cabbage\" isHighlighted={true} />.\n\nLet’s walk through an example to see when it’s useful.\n\nImagine a List component that renders its children as a list of selectable rows with a “Next” button that changes which row is selected. The List component needs to render the selected Row differently, so it clones every <Row> child that it has received, and adds an extra isHighlighted: true or isHighlighted: false prop:\n\nexport default function List({ children }) {\n\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"List\">\n\n      {Children.map(children, (child, index) =>\n\n        cloneElement(child, {\n\n          isHighlighted: index === selectedIndex \n\n        })\n\n      )}\n\nLet’s say the original JSX received by List looks like this:\n\n<List>\n\n  <Row title=\"Cabbage\" />\n\n  <Row title=\"Garlic\" />\n\n  <Row title=\"Apple\" />\n\n</List>\n\nBy cloning its children, the List can pass extra information to every Row inside. The result looks like this:\n\n<List>\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Cabbage\"\n\n    isHighlighted={true} \n\n  />\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Garlic\"\n\n    isHighlighted={false} \n\n  />\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Apple\"\n\n    isHighlighted={false} \n\n  />\n\n</List>\n\nNotice how pressing “Next” updates the state of the List, and highlights a different row:\n\nApp.js\nList.js\nRow.js\ndata.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Children, cloneElement, useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function List({ children }) {\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {Children.map(children, (child, index) =>\n        cloneElement(child, {\n          isHighlighted: index === selectedIndex \n        })\n      )}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setSelectedIndex(i =>\n          (i + 1) % Children.count(children)\n        );\n      }}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTo summarize, the List cloned the <Row /> elements it received and added an extra prop to them.\n\nPitfall\n\nCloning children makes it hard to tell how the data flows through your app. Try one of the alternatives.\n\nAlternatives \nPassing data with a render prop \n\nInstead of using cloneElement, consider accepting a render prop like renderItem. Here, List receives renderItem as a prop. List calls renderItem for every item and passes isHighlighted as an argument:\n\nexport default function List({ items, renderItem }) {\n\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"List\">\n\n      {items.map((item, index) => {\n\n        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;\n\n        return renderItem(item, isHighlighted);\n\n      })}\n\nThe renderItem prop is called a “render prop” because it’s a prop that specifies how to render something. For example, you can pass a renderItem implementation that renders a <Row> with the given isHighlighted value:\n\n<List\n\n  items={products}\n\n  renderItem={(product, isHighlighted) =>\n\n    <Row\n\n      key={product.id}\n\n      title={product.title}\n\n      isHighlighted={isHighlighted}\n\n    />\n\n  }\n\n/>\n\nThe end result is the same as with cloneElement:\n\n<List>\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Cabbage\"\n\n    isHighlighted={true} \n\n  />\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Garlic\"\n\n    isHighlighted={false} \n\n  />\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Apple\"\n\n    isHighlighted={false} \n\n  />\n\n</List>\n\nHowever, you can clearly trace where the isHighlighted value is coming from.\n\nApp.js\nList.js\nRow.js\ndata.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function List({ items, renderItem }) {\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {items.map((item, index) => {\n        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;\n        return renderItem(item, isHighlighted);\n      })}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setSelectedIndex(i =>\n          (i + 1) % items.length\n        );\n      }}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis pattern is preferred to cloneElement because it is more explicit.\n\nPassing data through context \n\nAnother alternative to cloneElement is to pass data through context.\n\nFor example, you can call createContext to define a HighlightContext:\n\nexport const HighlightContext = createContext(false);\n\nYour List component can wrap every item it renders into a HighlightContext provider:\n\nexport default function List({ items, renderItem }) {\n\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"List\">\n\n      {items.map((item, index) => {\n\n        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;\n\n        return (\n\n          <HighlightContext key={item.id} value={isHighlighted}>\n\n            {renderItem(item)}\n\n          </HighlightContext>\n\n        );\n\n      })}\n\nWith this approach, Row does not need to receive an isHighlighted prop at all. Instead, it reads the context:\n\nexport default function Row({ title }) {\n\n  const isHighlighted = useContext(HighlightContext);\n\n  // ...\n\nThis allows the calling component to not know or worry about passing isHighlighted to <Row>:\n\n<List\n\n  items={products}\n\n  renderItem={product =>\n\n    <Row title={product.title} />\n\n  }\n\n/>\n\nInstead, List and Row coordinate the highlighting logic through context.\n\nApp.js\nList.js\nRow.js\nHighlightContext.js\ndata.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { HighlightContext } from './HighlightContext.js';\n\nexport default function List({ items, renderItem }) {\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {items.map((item, index) => {\n        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;\n        return (\n          <HighlightContext\n            key={item.id}\n            value={isHighlighted}\n          >\n            {renderItem(item)}\n          </HighlightContext>\n        );\n      })}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setSelectedIndex(i =>\n          (i + 1) % items.length\n        );\n      }}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nLearn more about passing data through context.\n\nExtracting logic into a custom Hook \n\nAnother approach you can try is to extract the “non-visual” logic into your own Hook, and use the information returned by your Hook to decide what to render. For example, you could write a useList custom Hook like this:\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport default function useList(items) {\n\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n\n\n\n  function onNext() {\n\n    setSelectedIndex(i =>\n\n      (i + 1) % items.length\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  const selected = items[selectedIndex];\n\n  return [selected, onNext];\n\n}\n\nThen you could use it like this:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const [selected, onNext] = useList(products);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"List\">\n\n      {products.map(product =>\n\n        <Row\n\n          key={product.id}\n\n          title={product.title}\n\n          isHighlighted={selected === product}\n\n        />\n\n      )}\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <button onClick={onNext}>\n\n        Next\n\n      </button>\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe data flow is explicit, but the state is inside the useList custom Hook that you can use from any component:\n\nApp.js\nuseList.js\nRow.js\ndata.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport Row from './Row.js';\nimport useList from './useList.js';\nimport { products } from './data.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [selected, onNext] = useList(products);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {products.map(product =>\n        <Row\n          key={product.id}\n          title={product.title}\n          isHighlighted={selected === product}\n        />\n      )}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={onNext}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis approach is particularly useful if you want to reuse this logic between different components.\n\nPREVIOUS\nChildren\nNEXT\nComponent"

The state field must be an object. Do not mutate the state directly. If you wish to change the state, call setState with the new state.\n\nclass Counter extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    age: 42,\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  handleAgeChange = () => {\n\n    this.setState({\n\n      age: this.state.age + 1 \n\n    });\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    return (\n\n      <>\n\n        <button onClick={this.handleAgeChange}>\n\n        Increment age\n\n        </button>\n\n        <p>You are {this.state.age}.</p>\n\n      </>\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n}\nNote\n\nDefining state in class components is equivalent to calling useState in function components.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\nconstructor(props) \n\nThe constructor runs before your class component mounts (gets added to the screen). Typically, a constructor is only used for two purposes in React. It lets you declare state and bind your class methods to the class instance:\n\nclass Counter extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n\n    super(props);\n\n    this.state = { counter: 0 };\n\n    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  handleClick() {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\nIf you use modern JavaScript syntax, constructors are rarely needed. Instead, you can rewrite this code above using the public class field syntax which is supported both by modern browsers and tools like Babel:\n\nclass Counter extends Component {\n\n  state = { counter: 0 };\n\n\n\n  handleClick = () => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\nA constructor should not contain any side effects or subscriptions.\n\nParameters \nprops: The component’s initial props.\nReturns \n\nconstructor should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nDo not run any side effects or subscriptions in the constructor. Instead, use componentDidMount for that.\n\nInside a constructor, you need to call super(props) before any other statement. If you don’t do that, this.props will be undefined while the constructor runs, which can be confusing and cause bugs.\n\nConstructor is the only place where you can assign this.state directly. In all other methods, you need to use this.setState() instead. Do not call setState in the constructor.\n\nWhen you use server rendering, the constructor will run on the server too, followed by the render method. However, lifecycle methods like componentDidMount or componentWillUnmount will not run on the server.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will call constructor twice in development and then throw away one of the instances. This helps you notice the accidental side effects that need to be moved out of the constructor.\n\nNote\n\nThere is no exact equivalent for constructor in function components. To declare state in a function component, call useState. To avoid recalculating the initial state, pass a function to useState.\n\ncomponentDidCatch(error, info) \n\nIf you define componentDidCatch, React will call it when some child component (including distant children) throws an error during rendering. This lets you log that error to an error reporting service in production.\n\nTypically, it is used together with static getDerivedStateFromError which lets you update state in response to an error and display an error message to the user. A component with these methods is called an Error Boundary.\n\nSee an example.\n\nParameters \n\nerror: The error that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of Error but this is not guaranteed because JavaScript allows to throw any value, including strings or even null.\n\ninfo: An object containing additional information about the error. Its componentStack field contains a stack trace with the component that threw, as well as the names and source locations of all its parent components. In production, the component names will be minified. If you set up production error reporting, you can decode the component stack using sourcemaps the same way as you would do for regular JavaScript error stacks.\n\nReturns \n\ncomponentDidCatch should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nIn the past, it was common to call setState inside componentDidCatch in order to update the UI and display the fallback error message. This is deprecated in favor of defining static getDerivedStateFromError.\n\nProduction and development builds of React slightly differ in the way componentDidCatch handles errors. In development, the errors will bubble up to window, which means that any window.onerror or window.addEventListener('error', callback) will intercept the errors that have been caught by componentDidCatch. In production, instead, the errors will not bubble up, which means any ancestor error handler will only receive errors not explicitly caught by componentDidCatch.\n\nNote\n\nThere is no direct equivalent for componentDidCatch in function components yet. If you’d like to avoid creating class components, write a single ErrorBoundary component like above and use it throughout your app. Alternatively, you can use the react-error-boundary package which does that for you.\n\ncomponentDidMount() \n\nIf you define the componentDidMount method, React will call it when your component is added (mounted) to the screen. This is a common place to start data fetching, set up subscriptions, or manipulate the DOM nodes.\n\nIf you implement componentDidMount, you usually need to implement other lifecycle methods to avoid bugs. For example, if componentDidMount reads some state or props, you also have to implement componentDidUpdate to handle their changes, and componentWillUnmount to clean up whatever componentDidMount was doing.\n\nclass ChatRoom extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n\n    this.setupConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n\n    if (\n\n      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||\n\n      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl\n\n    ) {\n\n      this.destroyConnection();\n\n      this.setupConnection();\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n\n    this.destroyConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSee more examples.\n\nParameters \n\ncomponentDidMount does not take any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\ncomponentDidMount should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, in development React will call componentDidMount, then immediately call componentWillUnmount, and then call componentDidMount again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement componentWillUnmount or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what componentDidMount does.\n\nAlthough you may call setState immediately in componentDidMount, it’s best to avoid that when you can. It will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen. This guarantees that even though the render will be called twice in this case, the user won’t see the intermediate state. Use this pattern with caution because it often causes performance issues. In most cases, you should be able to assign the initial state in the constructor instead. It can, however, be necessary for cases like modals and tooltips when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position.\n\nNote\n\nFor many use cases, defining componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount together in class components is equivalent to calling useEffect in function components. In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, useLayoutEffect is a closer match.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\ncomponentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot?) \n\nIf you define the componentDidUpdate method, React will call it immediately after your component has been re-rendered with updated props or state.  This method is not called for the initial render.\n\nYou can use it to manipulate the DOM after an update. This is also a common place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props (e.g. a network request may not be necessary if the props have not changed). Typically, you’d use it together with componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount:\n\nclass ChatRoom extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n\n    this.setupConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n\n    if (\n\n      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||\n\n      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl\n\n    ) {\n\n      this.destroyConnection();\n\n      this.setupConnection();\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n\n    this.destroyConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSee more examples.\n\nParameters \n\nprevProps: Props before the update. Compare prevProps to this.props to determine what changed.\n\nprevState: State before the update. Compare prevState to this.state to determine what changed.\n\nsnapshot: If you implemented getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, snapshot will contain the value you returned from that method. Otherwise, it will be undefined.\n\nReturns \n\ncomponentDidUpdate should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\ncomponentDidUpdate will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.\n\nThe logic inside componentDidUpdate should usually be wrapped in conditions comparing this.props with prevProps, and this.state with prevState. Otherwise, there’s a risk of creating infinite loops.\n\nAlthough you may call setState immediately in componentDidUpdate, it’s best to avoid that when you can. It will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen. This guarantees that even though the render will be called twice in this case, the user won’t see the intermediate state. This pattern often causes performance issues, but it may be necessary for rare cases like modals and tooltips when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position.\n\nNote\n\nFor many use cases, defining componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount together in class components is equivalent to calling useEffect in function components. In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, useLayoutEffect is a closer match.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\ncomponentWillMount() \nDeprecated\n\nThis API has been renamed from componentWillMount to UNSAFE_componentWillMount. The old name has been deprecated. In a future major version of React, only the new name will work.\n\nRun the rename-unsafe-lifecycles codemod to automatically update your components.\n\ncomponentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) \nDeprecated\n\nThis API has been renamed from componentWillReceiveProps to UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps. The old name has been deprecated. In a future major version of React, only the new name will work.\n\nRun the rename-unsafe-lifecycles codemod to automatically update your components.\n\ncomponentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) \nDeprecated\n\nThis API has been renamed from componentWillUpdate to UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate. The old name has been deprecated. In a future major version of React, only the new name will work.\n\nRun the rename-unsafe-lifecycles codemod to automatically update your components.\n\ncomponentWillUnmount() \n\nIf you define the componentWillUnmount method, React will call it before your component is removed (unmounted) from the screen. This is a common place to cancel data fetching or remove subscriptions.\n\nThe logic inside componentWillUnmount should “mirror” the logic inside componentDidMount. For example, if componentDidMount sets up a subscription, componentWillUnmount should clean up that subscription. If the cleanup logic in your componentWillUnmount reads some props or state, you will usually also need to implement componentDidUpdate to clean up resources (such as subscriptions) corresponding to the old props and state.\n\nclass ChatRoom extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n\n    this.setupConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n\n    if (\n\n      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||\n\n      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl\n\n    ) {\n\n      this.destroyConnection();\n\n      this.setupConnection();\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n\n    this.destroyConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSee more examples.\n\nParameters \n\ncomponentWillUnmount does not take any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\ncomponentWillUnmount should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \nWhen Strict Mode is on, in development React will call componentDidMount, then immediately call componentWillUnmount, and then call componentDidMount again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement componentWillUnmount or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what componentDidMount does.\nNote\n\nFor many use cases, defining componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount together in class components is equivalent to calling useEffect in function components. In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, useLayoutEffect is a closer match.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\nforceUpdate(callback?) \n\nForces a component to re-render.\n\nUsually, this is not necessary. If your component’s render method only reads from this.props, this.state, or this.context, it will re-render automatically when you call setState inside your component or one of its parents. However, if your component’s render method reads directly from an external data source, you have to tell React to update the user interface when that data source changes. That’s what forceUpdate lets you do.\n\nTry to avoid all uses of forceUpdate and only read from this.props and this.state in render.\n\nParameters \noptional callback If specified, React will call the callback you’ve provided after the update is committed.\nReturns \n\nforceUpdate does not return anything.\n\nCaveats \nIf you call forceUpdate, React will re-render without calling shouldComponentUpdate.\nNote\n\nReading an external data source and forcing class components to re-render in response to its changes with forceUpdate has been superseded by useSyncExternalStore in function components.\n\ngetSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) \n\nIf you implement getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, React will call it immediately before React updates the DOM. It enables your component to capture some information from the DOM (e.g. scroll position) before it is potentially changed. Any value returned by this lifecycle method will be passed as a parameter to componentDidUpdate.\n\nFor example, you can use it in a UI like a chat thread that needs to preserve its scroll position during updates:\n\nclass ScrollingList extends React.Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n\n    super(props);\n\n    this.listRef = React.createRef();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n\n    // Are we adding new items to the list?\n\n    // Capture the scroll position so we can adjust scroll later.\n\n    if (prevProps.list.length < this.props.list.length) {\n\n      const list = this.listRef.current;\n\n      return list.scrollHeight - list.scrollTop;\n\n    }\n\n    return null;\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {\n\n    // If we have a snapshot value, we've just added new items.\n\n    // Adjust scroll so these new items don't push the old ones out of view.\n\n    // (snapshot here is the value returned from getSnapshotBeforeUpdate)\n\n    if (snapshot !== null) {\n\n      const list = this.listRef.current;\n\n      list.scrollTop = list.scrollHeight - snapshot;\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    return (\n\n      <div ref={this.listRef}>{/* ...contents... */}</div>\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nIn the above example, it is important to read the scrollHeight property directly in getSnapshotBeforeUpdate. It is not safe to read it in render, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps, or UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate because there is a potential time gap between these methods getting called and React updating the DOM.\n\nParameters \n\nprevProps: Props before the update. Compare prevProps to this.props to determine what changed.\n\nprevState: State before the update. Compare prevState to this.state to determine what changed.\n\nReturns \n\nYou should return a snapshot value of any type that you’d like, or null. The value you returned will be passed as the third argument to componentDidUpdate.\n\nCaveats \ngetSnapshotBeforeUpdate will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.\nNote\n\nAt the moment, there is no equivalent to getSnapshotBeforeUpdate for function components. This use case is very uncommon, but if you have the need for it, for now you’ll have to write a class component.\n\nrender() \n\nThe render method is the only required method in a class component.\n\nThe render method should specify what you want to appear on the screen, for example:\n\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\n\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nReact may call render at any moment, so you shouldn’t assume that it runs at a particular time. Usually, the render method should return a piece of JSX, but a few other return types (like strings) are supported. To calculate the returned JSX, the render method can read this.props, this.state, and this.context.\n\nYou should write the render method as a pure function, meaning that it should return the same result if props, state, and context are the same. It also shouldn’t contain side effects (like setting up subscriptions) or interact with the browser APIs. Side effects should happen either in event handlers or methods like componentDidMount.\n\nParameters \n\nrender does not take any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\nrender can return any valid React node. This includes React elements such as <div />, strings, numbers, portals, empty nodes (null, undefined, true, and false), and arrays of React nodes.\n\nCaveats \n\nrender should be written as a pure function of props, state, and context. It should not have side effects.\n\nrender will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will call render twice in development and then throw away one of the results. This helps you notice the accidental side effects that need to be moved out of the render method.\n\nThere is no one-to-one correspondence between the render call and the subsequent componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate call. Some of the render call results may be discarded by React when it’s beneficial.\n\nsetState(nextState, callback?) \n\nCall setState to update the state of your React component.\n\nclass Form extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    name: 'Taylor',\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  handleNameChange = (e) => {\n\n    const newName = e.target.value;\n\n    this.setState({\n\n      name: newName\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    return (\n\n      <>\n\n        <input value={this.state.name} onChange={this.handleNameChange} />\n\n        <p>Hello, {this.state.name}.</p>\n\n      </>\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nsetState enqueues changes to the component state. It tells React that this component and its children need to re-render with the new state. This is the main way you’ll update the user interface in response to interactions.\n\nPitfall\n\nCalling setState does not change the current state in the already executing code:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  console.log(this.state.name); // \"Taylor\"\n\n  this.setState({\n\n    name: 'Robin'\n\n  });\n\n  console.log(this.state.name); // Still \"Taylor\"!\n\n}\n\nIt only affects what this.state will return starting from the next render.\n\nYou can also pass a function to setState. It lets you update state based on the previous state:\n\n  handleIncreaseAge = () => {\n\n    this.setState(prevState => {\n\n      return {\n\n        age: prevState.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\nYou don’t have to do this, but it’s handy if you want to update state multiple times during the same event.\n\nParameters \n\nnextState: Either an object or a function.\n\nIf you pass an object as nextState, it will be shallowly merged into this.state.\nIf you pass a function as nextState, it will be treated as an updater function. It must be pure, should take the pending state and props as arguments, and should return the object to be shallowly merged into this.state. React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state.\n\noptional callback: If specified, React will call the callback you’ve provided after the update is committed.\n\nReturns \n\nsetState does not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nThink of setState as a request rather than an immediate command to update the component. When multiple components update their state in response to an event, React will batch their updates and re-render them together in a single pass at the end of the event. In the rare case that you need to force a particular state update to be applied synchronously, you may wrap it in flushSync, but this may hurt performance.\n\nsetState does not update this.state immediately. This makes reading this.state right after calling setState a potential pitfall. Instead, use componentDidUpdate or the setState callback argument, either of which are guaranteed to fire after the update has been applied. If you need to set the state based on the previous state, you can pass a function to nextState as described above.\n\nNote\n\nCalling setState in class components is similar to calling a set function in function components.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\nshouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState, nextContext) \n\nIf you define shouldComponentUpdate, React will call it to determine whether a re-render can be skipped.\n\nIf you are confident you want to write it by hand, you may compare this.props with nextProps and this.state with nextState and return false to tell React the update can be skipped.\n\nclass Rectangle extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    isHovered: false\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n\n    if (\n\n      nextProps.position.x === this.props.position.x &&\n\n      nextProps.position.y === this.props.position.y &&\n\n      nextProps.size.width === this.props.size.width &&\n\n      nextProps.size.height === this.props.size.height &&\n\n      nextState.isHovered === this.state.isHovered\n\n    ) {\n\n      // Nothing has changed, so a re-render is unnecessary\n\n      return false;\n\n    }\n\n    return true;\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nReact calls shouldComponentUpdate before rendering when new props or state are being received. Defaults to true. This method is not called for the initial render or when forceUpdate is used.\n\nParameters \nnextProps: The next props that the component is about to render with. Compare nextProps to this.props to determine what changed.\nnextState: The next state that the component is about to render with. Compare nextState to this.state to determine what changed.\nnextContext: The next context that the component is about to render with. Compare nextContext to this.context to determine what changed. Only available if you specify static contextType.\nReturns \n\nReturn true if you want the component to re-render. That’s the default behavior.\n\nReturn false to tell React that re-rendering can be skipped.\n\nCaveats \n\nThis method only exists as a performance optimization. If your component breaks without it, fix that first.\n\nConsider using PureComponent instead of writing shouldComponentUpdate by hand. PureComponent shallowly compares props and state, and reduces the chance that you’ll skip a necessary update.\n\nWe do not recommend doing deep equality checks or using JSON.stringify in shouldComponentUpdate. It makes performance unpredictable and dependent on the data structure of every prop and state. In the best case, you risk introducing multi-second stalls to your application, and in the worst case you risk crashing it.\n\nReturning false does not prevent child components from re-rendering when their state changes.\n\nReturning false does not guarantee that the component will not re-render. React will use the return value as a hint but it may still choose to re-render your component if it makes sense to do for other reasons.\n\nNote\n\nOptimizing class components with shouldComponentUpdate is similar to optimizing function components with memo. Function components also offer more granular optimization with useMemo.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount() \n\nIf you define UNSAFE_componentWillMount, React will call it immediately after the constructor. It only exists for historical reasons and should not be used in any new code. Instead, use one of the alternatives:\n\nTo initialize state, declare state as a class field or set this.state inside the constructor.\nIf you need to run a side effect or set up a subscription, move that logic to componentDidMount instead.\n\nSee examples of migrating away from unsafe lifecycles.\n\nParameters \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount does not take any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount will not get called if the component implements static getDerivedStateFromProps or getSnapshotBeforeUpdate.\n\nDespite its naming, UNSAFE_componentWillMount does not guarantee that the component will get mounted if your app uses modern React features like Suspense. If a render attempt is suspended (for example, because the code for some child component has not loaded yet), React will throw the in-progress tree away and attempt to construct the component from scratch during the next attempt. This is why this method is “unsafe”. Code that relies on mounting (like adding a subscription) should go into componentDidMount.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount is the only lifecycle method that runs during server rendering. For all practical purposes, it is identical to constructor, so you should use the constructor for this type of logic instead.\n\nNote\n\nCalling setState inside UNSAFE_componentWillMount in a class component to initialize state is equivalent to passing that state as the initial state to useState in a function component.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps, nextContext) \n\nIf you define UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps, React will call it when the component receives new props. It only exists for historical reasons and should not be used in any new code. Instead, use one of the alternatives:\n\nIf you need to run a side effect (for example, fetch data, run an animation, or reinitialize a subscription) in response to prop changes, move that logic to componentDidUpdate instead.\nIf you need to avoid re-computing some data only when a prop changes, use a memoization helper instead.\nIf you need to “reset” some state when a prop changes, consider either making a component fully controlled or fully uncontrolled with a key instead.\nIf you need to “adjust” some state when a prop changes, check whether you can compute all the necessary information from props alone during rendering. If you can’t, use static getDerivedStateFromProps instead.\n\nSee examples of migrating away from unsafe lifecycles.\n\nParameters \nnextProps: The next props that the component is about to receive from its parent component. Compare nextProps to this.props to determine what changed.\nnextContext: The next context that the component is about to receive from the closest provider. Compare nextContext to this.context to determine what changed. Only available if you specify static contextType.\nReturns \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps will not get called if the component implements static getDerivedStateFromProps or getSnapshotBeforeUpdate.\n\nDespite its naming, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps does not guarantee that the component will receive those props if your app uses modern React features like Suspense. If a render attempt is suspended (for example, because the code for some child component has not loaded yet), React will throw the in-progress tree away and attempt to construct the component from scratch during the next attempt. By the time of the next render attempt, the props might be different. This is why this method is “unsafe”. Code that should run only for committed updates (like resetting a subscription) should go into componentDidUpdate.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps does not mean that the component has received different props than the last time. You need to compare nextProps and this.props yourself to check if something changed.\n\nReact doesn’t call UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps with initial props during mounting. It only calls this method if some of component’s props are going to be updated. For example, calling setState doesn’t generally trigger UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps inside the same component.\n\nNote\n\nCalling setState inside UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps in a class component to “adjust” state is equivalent to calling the set function from useState during rendering in a function component.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) \n\nIf you define UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate, React will call it before rendering with the new props or state. It only exists for historical reasons and should not be used in any new code. Instead, use one of the alternatives:\n\nIf you need to run a side effect (for example, fetch data, run an animation, or reinitialize a subscription) in response to prop or state changes, move that logic to componentDidUpdate instead.\nIf you need to read some information from the DOM (for example, to save the current scroll position) so that you can use it in componentDidUpdate later, read it inside getSnapshotBeforeUpdate instead.\n\nSee examples of migrating away from unsafe lifecycles.\n\nParameters \nnextProps: The next props that the component is about to render with. Compare nextProps to this.props to determine what changed.\nnextState: The next state that the component is about to render with. Compare nextState to this.state to determine what changed.\nReturns \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillUpdate should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillUpdate will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillUpdate will not get called if the component implements static getDerivedStateFromProps or getSnapshotBeforeUpdate.\n\nIt’s not supported to call setState (or any method that leads to setState being called, like dispatching a Redux action) during componentWillUpdate.\n\nDespite its naming, UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate does not guarantee that the component will update if your app uses modern React features like Suspense. If a render attempt is suspended (for example, because the code for some child component has not loaded yet), React will throw the in-progress tree away and attempt to construct the component from scratch during the next attempt. By the time of the next render attempt, the props and state might be different. This is why this method is “unsafe”. Code that should run only for committed updates (like resetting a subscription) should go into componentDidUpdate.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillUpdate does not mean that the component has received different props or state than the last time. You need to compare nextProps with this.props and nextState with this.state yourself to check if something changed.\n\nReact doesn’t call UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate with initial props and state during mounting.\n\nNote\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate in function components.\n\nstatic contextType \n\nIf you want to read this.context from your class component, you must specify which context it needs to read. The context you specify as the static contextType must be a value previously created by createContext.\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n\n  static contextType = ThemeContext;\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    const theme = this.context;\n\n    const className = 'button-' + theme;\n\n    return (\n\n      <button className={className}>\n\n        {this.props.children}\n\n      </button>\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n}\nNote\n\nReading this.context in class components is equivalent to useContext in function components.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\nstatic defaultProps \n\nYou can define static defaultProps to set the default props for the class. They will be used for undefined and missing props, but not for null props.\n\nFor example, here is how you define that the color prop should default to 'blue':\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n\n  static defaultProps = {\n\n    color: 'blue'\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    return <button className={this.props.color}>click me</button>;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nIf the color prop is not provided or is undefined, it will be set by default to 'blue':\n\n<>\n\n  {/* this.props.color is \"blue\" */}\n\n  <Button />\n\n\n\n  {/* this.props.color is \"blue\" */}\n\n  <Button color={undefined} />\n\n\n\n  {/* this.props.color is null */}\n\n  <Button color={null} />\n\n\n\n  {/* this.props.color is \"red\" */}\n\n  <Button color=\"red\" />\n\n</>\nNote\n\nDefining defaultProps in class components is similar to using default values in function components.\n\nstatic getDerivedStateFromError(error) \n\nIf you define static getDerivedStateFromError, React will call it when a child component (including distant children) throws an error during rendering. This lets you display an error message instead of clearing the UI.\n\nTypically, it is used together with componentDidCatch which lets you send the error report to some analytics service. A component with these methods is called an Error Boundary.\n\nSee an example.\n\nParameters \nerror: The error that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of Error but this is not guaranteed because JavaScript allows to throw any value, including strings or even null.\nReturns \n\nstatic getDerivedStateFromError should return the state telling the component to display the error message.\n\nCaveats \nstatic getDerivedStateFromError should be a pure function. If you want to perform a side effect (for example, to call an analytics service), you need to also implement componentDidCatch.\nNote\n\nThere is no direct equivalent for static getDerivedStateFromError in function components yet. If you’d like to avoid creating class components, write a single ErrorBoundary component like above and use it throughout your app. Alternatively, use the react-error-boundary package which does that.\n\nstatic getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) \n\nIf you define static getDerivedStateFromProps, React will call it right before calling render, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates. It should return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing.\n\nThis method exists for rare use cases where the state depends on changes in props over time. For example, this Form component resets the email state when the userID prop changes:\n\nclass Form extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    email: this.props.defaultEmail,\n\n    prevUserID: this.props.userID\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {\n\n    // Any time the current user changes,\n\n    // Reset any parts of state that are tied to that user.\n\n    // In this simple example, that's just the email.\n\n    if (props.userID !== state.prevUserID) {\n\n      return {\n\n        prevUserID: props.userID,\n\n        email: props.defaultEmail\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    return null;\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNote that this pattern requires you to keep a previous value of the prop (like userID) in state (like prevUserID).\n\nPitfall\n\nDeriving state leads to verbose code and makes your components difficult to think about. Make sure you’re familiar with simpler alternatives:\n\nIf you need to perform a side effect (for example, data fetching or an animation) in response to a change in props, use componentDidUpdate method instead.\nIf you want to re-compute some data only when a prop changes, use a memoization helper instead.\nIf you want to “reset” some state when a prop changes, consider either making a component fully controlled or fully uncontrolled with a key instead.\nParameters \nprops: The next props that the component is about to render with.\nstate: The next state that the component is about to render with.\nReturns \n\nstatic getDerivedStateFromProps return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing.\n\nCaveats \n\nThis method is fired on every render, regardless of the cause. This is different from UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps, which only fires when the parent causes a re-render and not as a result of a local setState.\n\nThis method doesn’t have access to the component instance. If you’d like, you can reuse some code between static getDerivedStateFromProps and the other class methods by extracting pure functions of the component props and state outside the class definition.\n\nNote\n\nImplementing static getDerivedStateFromProps in a class component is equivalent to calling the set function from useState during rendering in a function component.\n\nUsage \nDefining a class component \n\nTo define a React component as a class, extend the built-in Component class and define a render method:\n\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\n\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nReact will call your render method whenever it needs to figure out what to display on the screen. Usually, you will return some JSX from it. Your render method should be a pure function: it should only calculate the JSX.\n\nSimilarly to function components, a class component can receive information by props from its parent component. However, the syntax for reading props is different. For example, if the parent component renders <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />, then you can read the name prop from this.props, like this.props.name:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Greeting name=\"Sara\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Cahal\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Edite\" />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNote that Hooks (functions starting with use, like useState) are not supported inside class components.\n\nPitfall\n\nWe recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.\n\nAdding state to a class component \n\nTo add state to a class, assign an object to a property called state. To update state, call this.setState.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\nexport default class Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    name: 'Taylor',\n    age: 42,\n  };\n\n  handleNameChange = (e) => {\n    this.setState({\n      name: e.target.value\n    });\n  }\n\n  handleAgeChange = () => {\n    this.setState({\n      age: this.state.age + 1 \n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <input\n          value={this.state.name}\n          onChange={this.handleNameChange}\n        />\n        <button onClick={this.handleAgeChange}>\n          Increment age\n        </button>\n        <p>Hello, {this.state.name}. You are {this.state.age}.</p>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nWe recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.\n\nAdding lifecycle methods to a class component \n\nThere are a few special methods you can define on your class.\n\nIf you define the componentDidMount method, React will call it when your component is added (mounted) to the screen. React will call componentDidUpdate after your component re-renders due to changed props or state. React will call componentWillUnmount after your component has been removed (unmounted) from the screen.\n\nIf you implement componentDidMount, you usually need to implement all three lifecycles to avoid bugs. For example, if componentDidMount reads some state or props, you also have to implement componentDidUpdate to handle their changes, and componentWillUnmount to clean up whatever componentDidMount was doing.\n\nFor example, this ChatRoom component keeps a chat connection synchronized with props and state:\n\nApp.js\nChatRoom.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nexport default class ChatRoom extends Component {\n  state = {\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'\n  };\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.setupConnection();\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n    if (\n      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||\n      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl\n    ) {\n      this.destroyConnection();\n      this.setupConnection();\n    }\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.destroyConnection();\n  }\n\n  setupConnection() {\n    this.connection = createConnection(\n      this.state.serverUrl,\n      this.props.roomId\n    );\n    this.connection.connect();    \n  }\n\n  destroyConnection() {\n    this.connection.disconnect();\n    this.connection = null;\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <label>\n          Server URL:{' '}\n          <input\n            value={this.state.serverUrl}\n            onChange={e => {\n              this.setState({\n                serverUrl: e.target.value\n              });\n            }}\n          />\n        </label>\n        <h1>Welcome to the {this.props.roomId} room!</h1>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNote that in development when Strict Mode is on, React will call componentDidMount, immediately call componentWillUnmount, and then call componentDidMount again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement componentWillUnmount or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what componentDidMount does.\n\nPitfall\n\nWe recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.\n\nCatching rendering errors with an Error Boundary \n\nBy default, if your application throws an error during rendering, React will remove its UI from the screen. To prevent this, you can wrap a part of your UI into an Error Boundary. An Error Boundary is a special component that lets you display some fallback UI instead of the part that crashed—for example, an error message.\n\nTo implement an Error Boundary component, you need to provide static getDerivedStateFromError which lets you update state in response to an error and display an error message to the user. You can also optionally implement componentDidCatch to add some extra logic, for example, to log the error to an analytics service.\n\nWith captureOwnerStack you can include the Owner Stack during development.\n\nimport * as React from 'react';\n\n\n\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n\n    super(props);\n\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\n\n    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.\n\n    return { hasError: true };\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidCatch(error, info) {\n\n    logErrorToMyService(\n\n      error,\n\n      // Example \"componentStack\":\n\n      //   in ComponentThatThrows (created by App)\n\n      //   in ErrorBoundary (created by App)\n\n      //   in div (created by App)\n\n      //   in App\n\n      info.componentStack,\n\n      // Warning: `captureOwnerStack` is not available in production.\n\n      React.captureOwnerStack(),\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n\n      // You can render any custom fallback UI\n\n      return this.props.fallback;\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    return this.props.children;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nThen you can wrap a part of your component tree with it:\n\n<ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>Something went wrong</p>}>\n\n  <Profile />\n\n</ErrorBoundary>\n\nIf Profile or its child component throws an error, ErrorBoundary will “catch” that error, display a fallback UI with the error message you’ve provided, and send a production error report to your error reporting service.\n\nYou don’t need to wrap every component into a separate Error Boundary. When you think about the granularity of Error Boundaries, consider where it makes sense to display an error message. For example, in a messaging app, it makes sense to place an Error Boundary around the list of conversations. It also makes sense to place one around every individual message. However, it wouldn’t make sense to place a boundary around every avatar.\n\nNote\n\nThere is currently no way to write an Error Boundary as a function component. However, you don’t have to write the Error Boundary class yourself. For example, you can use react-error-boundary instead.\n\nAlternatives \nMigrating a simple component from a class to a function \n\nTypically, you will define components as functions instead.\n\nFor example, suppose you’re converting this Greeting class component to a function:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Greeting name=\"Sara\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Cahal\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Edite\" />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nDefine a function called Greeting. This is where you will move the body of your render function.\n\nfunction Greeting() {\n\n  // ... move the code from the render method here ...\n\n}\n\nInstead of this.props.name, define the name prop using the destructuring syntax and read it directly:\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n\n}\n\nHere is a complete example:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Greeting name=\"Sara\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Cahal\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Edite\" />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nMigrating a component with state from a class to a function \n\nSuppose you’re converting this Counter class component to a function:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\nexport default class Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    name: 'Taylor',\n    age: 42,\n  };\n\n  handleNameChange = (e) => {\n    this.setState({\n      name: e.target.value\n    });\n  }\n\n  handleAgeChange = (e) => {\n    this.setState({\n      age: this.state.age + 1 \n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <input\n          value={this.state.name}\n          onChange={this.handleNameChange}\n        />\n        <button onClick={this.handleAgeChange}>\n          Increment age\n        </button>\n        <p>Hello, {this.state.name}.

For example, replace this.state.age with age, and replace this.handleNameChange with handleNameChange.\n\nHere is a fully converted component:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\n  function handleNameChange(e) {\n    setName(e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  function handleAgeChange() {\n    setAge(age + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input\n        value={name}\n        onChange={handleNameChange}\n      />\n      <button onClick={handleAgeChange}>\n        Increment age\n      </button>\n      <p>Hello, {name}. You are {age}.</p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\nMigrating a component with lifecycle methods from a class to a function \n\nSuppose you’re converting this ChatRoom class component with lifecycle methods to a function:\n\nApp.js\nChatRoom.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nexport default class ChatRoom extends Component {\n  state = {\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'\n  };\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.setupConnection();\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n    if (\n      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||\n      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl\n    ) {\n      this.destroyConnection();\n      this.setupConnection();\n    }\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.destroyConnection();\n  }\n\n  setupConnection() {\n    this.connection = createConnection(\n      this.state.serverUrl,\n      this.props.roomId\n    );\n    this.connection.connect();    \n  }\n\n  destroyConnection() {\n    this.connection.disconnect();\n    this.connection = null;\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <label>\n          Server URL:{' '}\n          <input\n            value={this.state.serverUrl}\n            onChange={e => {\n              this.setState({\n                serverUrl: e.target.value\n              });\n            }}\n          />\n        </label>\n        <h1>Welcome to the {this.props.roomId} room!</h1>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nFirst, verify that your componentWillUnmount does the opposite of componentDidMount. In the above example, that’s true: it disconnects the connection that componentDidMount sets up. If such logic is missing, add it first.\n\nNext, verify that your componentDidUpdate method handles changes to any props and state you’re using in componentDidMount. In the above example, componentDidMount calls setupConnection which reads this.state.serverUrl and this.props.roomId. This is why componentDidUpdate checks whether this.state.serverUrl and this.props.roomId have changed, and resets the connection if they did. If your componentDidUpdate logic is missing or doesn’t handle changes to all relevant props and state, fix that first.\n\nIn the above example, the logic inside the lifecycle methods connects the component to a system outside of React (a chat server). To connect a component to an external system, describe this logic as a single Effect:\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis useEffect call is equivalent to the logic in the lifecycle methods above. If your lifecycle methods do multiple unrelated things, split them into multiple independent Effects. Here is a complete example you can play with:\n\nApp.js\nChatRoom.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => {\n      connection.disconnect();\n    };\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nIf your component does not synchronize with any external systems, you might not need an Effect.\n\nMigrating a component with context from a class to a function \n\nIn this example, the Panel and Button class components read context from this.context:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, Component } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nclass Panel extends Component {\n  static contextType = ThemeContext;\n\n  render() {\n    const theme = this.context;\n    const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n    return (\n      <section className={className}>\n        <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>\n        {this.props.children}\n      </section>\n    );    \n  }\n}\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n  static contextType = ThemeContext;\n\n  render() {\n    const theme = this.context;\n    const className = 'button-' + theme;\n    return (\n      <button className={className}>\n        {this.props.children}\n      </button>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n      <Form />\n    </ThemeContext>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen you convert them to function components, replace this.context with useContext calls:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, useContext } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <section className={className}>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Button({ children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'button-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <button className={className}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n      <Form />\n    </ThemeContext>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPREVIOUS\ncloneElement\nNEXT\ncreateElement"

    "title": "createElement – React",
    "url": "https://react.dev/reference/react/createElement",
    "html": "API REFERENCE\nLEGACY REACT APIS\ncreateElement\n\ncreateElement lets you create a React element. It serves as an alternative to writing JSX.\n\nconst element = createElement(type, props, ...children)\nReference\ncreateElement(type, props, ...children)\nUsage\nCreating an element without JSX\nReference \ncreateElement(type, props, ...children) \n\nCall createElement to create a React element with the given type, props, and children.\n\nimport { createElement } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return createElement(\n\n    'h1',\n\n    { className: 'greeting' },\n\n    'Hello'\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\ntype: The type argument must be a valid React component type. For example, it could be a tag name string (such as 'div' or 'span'), or a React component (a function, a class, or a special component like Fragment).\n\nprops: The props argument must either be an object or null. If you pass null, it will be treated the same as an empty object. React will create an element with props matching the props you have passed. Note that ref and key from your props object are special and will not be available as element.props.ref and element.props.key on the returned element. They will be available as element.ref and element.key.\n\noptional ...children: Zero or more child nodes. They can be any React nodes, including React elements, strings, numbers, portals, empty nodes (null, undefined, true, and false), and arrays of React nodes.\n\nReturns \n\ncreateElement returns a React element object with a few properties:\n\ntype: The type you have passed.\nprops: The props you have passed except for ref and key.\nref: The ref you have passed. If missing, null.\nkey: The key you have passed, coerced to a string. If missing, null.\n\nUsually, you’ll return the element from your component or make it a child of another element. Although you may read the element’s properties, it’s best to treat every element as opaque after it’s created, and only render it.\n\nCaveats \n\nYou must treat React elements and their props as immutable and never change their contents after creation. In development, React will freeze the returned element and its props property shallowly to enforce this.\n\nWhen you use JSX, you must start a tag with a capital letter to render your own custom component. In other words, <Something /> is equivalent to createElement(Something), but <something /> (lowercase) is equivalent to createElement('something') (note it’s a string, so it will be treated as a built-in HTML tag).\n\nYou should only pass children as multiple arguments to createElement if they are all statically known, like createElement('h1', {}, child1, child2, child3). If your children are dynamic, pass the entire array as the third argument: createElement('ul', {}, listItems). This ensures that React will warn you about missing keys for any dynamic lists. For static lists this is not necessary because they never reorder.\n\nUsage \nCreating an element without JSX \n\nIf you don’t like JSX or can’t use it in your project, you can use createElement as an alternative.\n\nTo create an element without JSX, call createElement with some type, props, and children:\n\nimport { createElement } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return createElement(\n\n    'h1',\n\n    { className: 'greeting' },\n\n    'Hello ',\n\n    createElement('i', null, name),\n\n    '. Welcome!'\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe children are optional, and you can pass as many as you need (the example above has three children). This code will display a <h1> header with a greeting. For comparison, here is the same example rewritten with JSX:\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <h1 className=\"greeting\">\n\n      Hello <i>{name}</i>. Welcome!\n\n    </h1>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nTo render your own React component, pass a function like Greeting as the type instead of a string like 'h1':\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return createElement(Greeting, { name: 'Taylor' });\n\n}\n\nWith JSX, it would look like this:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />;\n\n}\n\nHere is a complete example written with createElement:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createElement } from 'react';\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n  return createElement(\n    'h1',\n    { className: 'greeting' },\n    'Hello ',\n    createElement('i', null, name),\n    '. Welcome!'\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return createElement(\n    Greeting,\n    { name: 'Taylor' }\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nAnd here is the same example written using JSX:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n  return (\n    <h1 className=\"greeting\">\n      Hello <i>{name}</i>. Welcome!\n    </h1>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />;\n}\n\n\n\nBoth coding styles are fine, so you can use whichever one you prefer for your project. The main benefit of using JSX compared to createElement is that it’s easy to see which closing tag corresponds to which opening tag.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhat is a React element, exactly? \nShow Details\nPREVIOUS\nComponent\nNEXT\ncreateRef"

React calls this function with the props and ref that your component received from its parent. The JSX you return will be the output of your component.\nReturns \n\nforwardRef returns a React component that you can render in JSX. Unlike React components defined as plain functions, a component returned by forwardRef is also able to receive a ref prop.\n\nCaveats \nIn Strict Mode, React will call your render function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your render function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the logic of your component. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.\nrender function \n\nforwardRef accepts a render function as an argument. React calls this function with props and ref:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {props.label}\n\n      <input ref={ref} />\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\nParameters \n\nprops: The props passed by the parent component.\n\nref:  The ref attribute passed by the parent component. The ref can be an object or a function. If the parent component has not passed a ref, it will be null. You should either pass the ref you receive to another component, or pass it to useImperativeHandle.\n\nReturns \n\nforwardRef returns a React component that you can render in JSX. Unlike React components defined as plain functions, the component returned by forwardRef is able to take a ref prop.\n\nUsage \nExposing a DOM node to the parent component \n\nBy default, each component’s DOM nodes are private. However, sometimes it’s useful to expose a DOM node to the parent—for example, to allow focusing it. To opt in, wrap your component definition into forwardRef():\n\nimport { forwardRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  const { label, ...otherProps } = props;\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <input {...otherProps} />\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nYou will receive a ref as the second argument after props. Pass it to the DOM node that you want to expose:\n\nimport { forwardRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  const { label, ...otherProps } = props;\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <input {...otherProps} ref={ref} />\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nThis lets the parent Form component access the <input> DOM node exposed by MyInput:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    ref.current.focus();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <form>\n\n      <MyInput label=\"Enter your name:\" ref={ref} />\n\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n\n        Edit\n\n      </button>\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis Form component passes a ref to MyInput. The MyInput component forwards that ref to the <input> browser tag. As a result, the Form component can access that <input> DOM node and call focus() on it.\n\nKeep in mind that exposing a ref to the DOM node inside your component makes it harder to change your component’s internals later. You will typically expose DOM nodes from reusable low-level components like buttons or text inputs, but you won’t do it for application-level components like an avatar or a comment.\n\nExamples of forwarding a ref\n1. Focusing a text input\n2. Playing and pausing a video\nExample 1 of 2: Focusing a text input \n\nClicking the button will focus the input. The Form component defines a ref and passes it to the MyInput component. The MyInput component forwards that ref to the browser <input>. This lets the Form component focus the <input>.\n\nApp.js\nMyInput.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport MyInput from './MyInput.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <MyInput label=\"Enter your name:\" ref={ref} />\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n        Edit\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nForwarding a ref through multiple components \n\nInstead of forwarding a ref to a DOM node, you can forward it to your own component like MyInput:\n\nconst FormField = forwardRef(function FormField(props, ref) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MyInput ref={ref} />\n\n      ...\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nIf that MyInput component forwards a ref to its <input>, a ref to FormField will give you that <input>:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    ref.current.focus();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <form>\n\n      <FormField label=\"Enter your name:\" ref={ref} isRequired={true} />\n\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n\n        Edit\n\n      </button>\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe Form component defines a ref and passes it to FormField. The FormField component forwards that ref to MyInput, which forwards it to a browser <input> DOM node. This is how Form accesses that DOM node.\n\nApp.js\nFormField.js\nMyInput.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport FormField from './FormField.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <FormField label=\"Enter your name:\" ref={ref} isRequired={true} />\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n        Edit\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nExposing an imperative handle instead of a DOM node \n\nInstead of exposing an entire DOM node, you can expose a custom object, called an imperative handle, with a more constrained set of methods. To do this, you’d need to define a separate ref to hold the DOM node:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n\n\n  return <input {...props} ref={inputRef} />;\n\n});\n\nPass the ref you received to useImperativeHandle and specify the value you want to expose to the ref:\n\nimport { forwardRef, useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {\n\n    return {\n\n      focus() {\n\n        inputRef.current.focus();\n\n      },\n\n      scrollIntoView() {\n\n        inputRef.current.scrollIntoView();\n\n      },\n\n    };\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return <input {...props} ref={inputRef} />;\n\n});\n\nIf some component gets a ref to MyInput, it will only receive your { focus, scrollIntoView } object instead of the DOM node. This lets you limit the information you expose about your DOM node to the minimum.\n\nApp.js\nMyInput.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport MyInput from './MyInput.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current.focus();\n    // This won't work because the DOM node isn't exposed:\n    // ref.current.style.opacity = 0.5;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <MyInput placeholder=\"Enter your name\" ref={ref} />\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n        Edit\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nRead more about using imperative handles.\n\nPitfall\n\nDo not overuse refs. You should only use refs for imperative behaviors that you can’t express as props: for example, scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, and so on.\n\nIf you can express something as a prop, you should not use a ref. For example, instead of exposing an imperative handle like { open, close } from a Modal component, it is better to take isOpen as a prop like <Modal isOpen={isOpen} />. Effects can help you expose imperative behaviors via props.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy component is wrapped in forwardRef, but the ref to it is always null \n\nThis usually means that you forgot to actually use the ref that you received.\n\nFor example, this component doesn’t do anything with its ref:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label }, ref) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <input />\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nTo fix it, pass the ref down to a DOM node or another component that can accept a ref:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label }, ref) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <input ref={ref} />\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nThe ref to MyInput could also be null if some of the logic is conditional:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label, showInput }, ref) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      {showInput && <input ref={ref} />}\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nIf showInput is false, then the ref won’t be forwarded to any node, and a ref to MyInput will remain empty. This is particularly easy to miss if the condition is hidden inside another component, like Panel in this example:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label, showInput }, ref) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <Panel isExpanded={showInput}>\n\n        <input ref={ref} />\n\n      </Panel>\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\nPREVIOUS\ncreateRef\nNEXT\nisValidElement"

Extending PureComponent is equivalent to defining a custom shouldComponentUpdate method that shallowly compares props and state.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nUsage \nSkipping unnecessary re-renders for class components \n\nReact normally re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders. As an optimization, you can create a component that React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its new props and state are the same as the old props and state. Class components can opt into this behavior by extending PureComponent:\n\nclass Greeting extends PureComponent {\n\n  render() {\n\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nA React component should always have pure rendering logic. This means that it must return the same output if its props, state, and context haven’t changed. By using PureComponent, you are telling React that your component complies with this requirement, so React doesn’t need to re-render as long as its props and state haven’t changed. However, your component will still re-render if a context that it’s using changes.\n\nIn this example, notice that the Greeting component re-renders whenever name is changed (because that’s one of its props), but not when address is changed (because it’s not passed to Greeting as a prop):\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { PureComponent, useState } from 'react';\n\nclass Greeting extends PureComponent {\n  render() {\n    console.log(\"Greeting was rendered at\", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());\n    return <h3>Hello{this.props.name && ', '}{this.props.name}!</h3>;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n  const [address, setAddress] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Name{': '}\n        <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Address{': '}\n        <input value={address} onChange={e => setAddress(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Greeting name={name} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nWe recommend defining components as functions instead of classes.
