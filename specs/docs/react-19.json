    "html": "API REFERENCE\nBuilt-in React Hooks\n\nHooks let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in Hooks or combine them to build your own. This page lists all built-in Hooks in React.\n\nState Hooks \n\nState lets a component “remember” information like user input. For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index.\n\nTo add state to a component, use one of these Hooks:\n\nuseState declares a state variable that you can update directly.\nuseReducer declares a state variable with the update logic inside a reducer function.\nfunction ImageGallery() {\n\n  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);\n\n  // ...\nContext Hooks \n\nContext lets a component receive information from distant parents without passing it as props. For example, your app’s top-level component can pass the current UI theme to all components below, no matter how deep.\n\nuseContext reads and subscribes to a context.\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  // ...\nRef Hooks \n\nRefs let a component hold some information that isn’t used for rendering, like a DOM node or a timeout ID. Unlike with state, updating a ref does not re-render your component. Refs are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. They are useful when you need to work with non-React systems, such as the built-in browser APIs.\n\nuseRef declares a ref. You can hold any value in it, but most often it’s used to hold a DOM node.\nuseImperativeHandle lets you customize the ref exposed by your component. This is rarely used.\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  // ...\nEffect Hooks \n\nEffects let a component connect to and synchronize with external systems. This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code.\n\nuseEffect connects a component to an external system.\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n\nEffects are an “escape hatch” from the React paradigm. Don’t use Effects to orchestrate the data flow of your application. If you’re not interacting with an external system, you might not need an Effect.\n\nThere are two rarely used variations of useEffect with differences in timing:\n\nuseLayoutEffect fires before the browser repaints the screen. You can measure layout here.\nuseInsertionEffect fires before React makes changes to the DOM. Libraries can insert dynamic CSS here.\nPerformance Hooks \n\nA common way to optimize re-rendering performance is to skip unnecessary work. For example, you can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data has not changed since the previous render.\n\nTo skip calculations and unnecessary re-rendering, use one of these Hooks:\n\nuseMemo lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.\nuseCallback lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSometimes, you can’t skip re-rendering because the screen actually needs to update. In that case, you can improve performance by separating blocking updates that must be synchronous (like typing into an input) from non-blocking updates which don’t need to block the user interface (like updating a chart).\n\nTo prioritize rendering, use one of these Hooks:\n\nuseTransition lets you mark a state transition as non-blocking and allow other updates to interrupt it.\nuseDeferredValue lets you defer updating a non-critical part of the UI and let other parts update first.\nOther Hooks \n\nThese Hooks are mostly useful to library authors and aren’t commonly used in the application code.\n\nuseDebugValue lets you customize the label React DevTools displays for your custom Hook.\nuseId lets a component associate a unique ID with itself. Typically used with accessibility APIs.\nuseSyncExternalStore lets a component subscribe to an external store.\nuseActionState allows you to manage state of actions.\nYour own Hooks \n\nYou can also define your own custom Hooks as JavaScript functions.\n\nPREVIOUS\nOverview\nNEXT\nuseActionState"

    "title": "useActionState – React",
    "url": "https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState",
    "html": "API REFERENCE\nHOOKS\nuseActionState\n\nuseActionState is a Hook that allows you to update state based on the result of a form action.\n\nconst [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(fn, initialState, permalink?);\nNote\n\nIn earlier React Canary versions, this API was part of React DOM and called useFormState.\n\nReference\nuseActionState(action, initialState, permalink?)\nUsage\nUsing information returned by a form action\nTroubleshooting\nMy action can no longer read the submitted form data\nReference \nuseActionState(action, initialState, permalink?) \n\nCall useActionState at the top level of your component to create component state that is updated when a form action is invoked. You pass useActionState an existing form action function as well as an initial state, and it returns a new action that you use in your form, along with the latest form state and whether the Action is still pending. The latest form state is also passed to the function that you provided.\n\nimport { useActionState } from \"react\";\n\n\n\nasync function increment(previousState, formData) {\n\n  return previousState + 1;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction StatefulForm({}) {\n\n  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(increment, 0);\n\n  return (\n\n    <form>\n\n      {state}\n\n      <button formAction={formAction}>Increment</button>\n\n    </form>\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nThe form state is the value returned by the action when the form was last submitted. If the form has not yet been submitted, it is the initial state that you pass.\n\nIf used with a Server Function, useActionState allows the server’s response from submitting the form to be shown even before hydration has completed.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \nfn: The function to be called when the form is submitted or button pressed. When the function is called, it will receive the previous state of the form (initially the initialState that you pass, subsequently its previous return value) as its initial argument, followed by the arguments that a form action normally receives.\ninitialState: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be any serializable value. This argument is ignored after the action is first invoked.\noptional permalink: A string containing the unique page URL that this form modifies. For use on pages with dynamic content (eg: feeds) in conjunction with progressive enhancement: if fn is a server function and the form is submitted before the JavaScript bundle loads, the browser will navigate to the specified permalink URL, rather than the current page’s URL. Ensure that the same form component is rendered on the destination page (including the same action fn and permalink) so that React knows how to pass the state through. Once the form has been hydrated, this parameter has no effect.\nReturns \n\nuseActionState returns an array with the following values:\n\nThe current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed. After the action is invoked, it will match the value returned by the action.\nA new action that you can pass as the action prop to your form component or formAction prop to any button component within the form. The action can also be called manually within startTransition.\nThe isPending flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition.\nCaveats \nWhen used with a framework that supports React Server Components, useActionState lets you make forms interactive before JavaScript has executed on the client. When used without Server Components, it is equivalent to component local state.\nThe function passed to useActionState receives an extra argument, the previous or initial state, as its first argument. This makes its signature different than if it were used directly as a form action without using useActionState.\nUsage \nUsing information returned by a form action \n\nCall useActionState at the top level of your component to access the return value of an action from the last time a form was submitted.\n\nimport { useActionState } from 'react';\n\nimport { action } from './actions.js';\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const [state, formAction] = useActionState(action, null);\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <form action={formAction}>\n\n      {/* ... */}\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nuseActionState returns an array with the following items:\n\nThe current state of the form, which is initially set to the initial state you provided, and after the form is submitted is set to the return value of the action you provided.\nA new action that you pass to <form> as its action prop or call manually within startTransition.\nA pending state that you can utilise while your action is processing.\n\nWhen the form is submitted, the action function that you provided will be called. Its return value will become the new current state of the form.\n\nThe action that you provide will also receive a new first argument, namely the current state of the form. The first time the form is submitted, this will be the initial state you provided, while with subsequent submissions, it will be the return value from the last time the action was called. The rest of the arguments are the same as if useActionState had not been used.\n\nfunction action(currentState, formData) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return 'next state';\n\n}\nDisplay information after submitting a form\n1. Display form errors\n2. Display structured information after submitting a form\nExample 1 of 2: Display form errors \n\nTo display messages such as an error message or toast that’s returned by a Server Function, wrap the action in a call to useActionState.\n\nApp.js\nactions.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useActionState, useState } from \"react\";\nimport { addToCart } from \"./actions.js\";\n\nfunction AddToCartForm({itemID, itemTitle}) {\n  const [message, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(addToCart, null);\n  return (\n    <form action={formAction}>\n      <h2>{itemTitle}</h2>\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"itemID\" value={itemID} />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Add to Cart</button>\n      {isPending ? \"Loading...\" : message}\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <AddToCartForm itemID=\"1\" itemTitle=\"JavaScript: The Definitive Guide\" />\n      <AddToCartForm itemID=\"2\" itemTitle=\"JavaScript: The Good Parts\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nTroubleshooting \nMy action can no longer read the submitted form data \n\nWhen you wrap an action with useActionState, it gets an extra argument as its first argument. The submitted form data is therefore its second argument instead of its first as it would usually be. The new first argument that gets added is the current state of the form.\n\nfunction action(currentState, formData) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\nHooks\nNEXT\nuseCallback"

    "url": "https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback",
    "html": "API REFERENCE\nHOOKS\nuseCallback\n\nuseCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.\n\nconst cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies)\nNote\n\nReact Compiler automatically memoizes values and functions, reducing the need for manual useCallback calls. You can use the compiler to handle memoization automatically.\n\nReference\nuseCallback(fn, dependencies)\nUsage\nSkipping re-rendering of components\nUpdating state from a memoized callback\nPreventing an Effect from firing too often\nOptimizing a custom Hook\nTroubleshooting\nEvery time my component renders, useCallback returns a different function\nI need to call useCallback for each list item in a loop, but it’s not allowed\nReference \nuseCallback(fn, dependencies) \n\nCall useCallback at the top level of your component to cache a function definition between re-renders:\n\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nfn: The function value that you want to cache. It can take any arguments and return any values. React will return (not call!) your function back to you during the initial render. On next renders, React will give you the same function again if the dependencies have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will give you the function that you have passed during the current render, and store it in case it can be reused later. React will not call your function. The function is returned to you so you can decide when and whether to call it.\n\ndependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the fn code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison algorithm.\n\nReturns \n\nOn the initial render, useCallback returns the fn function you have passed.\n\nDuring subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored fn function from the last render (if the dependencies haven’t changed), or return the fn function you have passed during this render.\n\nCaveats \nuseCallback is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.\nReact will not throw away the cached function unless there is a specific reason to do that. For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache—for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should match your expectations if you rely on useCallback as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a state variable or a ref may be more appropriate.\nUsage \nSkipping re-rendering of components \n\nWhen you optimize rendering performance, you will sometimes need to cache the functions that you pass to child components. Let’s first look at the syntax for how to do this, and then see in which cases it’s useful.\n\nTo cache a function between re-renders of your component, wrap its definition into the useCallback Hook:\n\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n  // ...\n\nYou need to pass two things to useCallback:\n\nA function definition that you want to cache between re-renders.\nA list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your function.\n\nOn the initial render, the returned function you’ll get from useCallback will be the function you passed.\n\nOn the following renders, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the previous render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with Object.is), useCallback will return the same function as before. Otherwise, useCallback will return the function you passed on this render.\n\nIn other words, useCallback caches a function between re-renders until its dependencies change.\n\nLet’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.\n\nSay you’re passing a handleSubmit function down from the ProductPage to the ShippingForm component:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\nYou’ve noticed that toggling the theme prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove <ShippingForm /> from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the ShippingForm component.\n\nBy default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively. This is why, when ProductPage re-renders with a different theme, the ShippingForm component also re-renders. This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. But if you verified a re-render is slow, you can tell ShippingForm to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in memo:\n\nimport { memo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst ShippingForm = memo(function ShippingForm({ onSubmit }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nWith this change, ShippingForm will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the same as on the last render. This is when caching a function becomes important! Let’s say you defined handleSubmit without useCallback:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  // Every time the theme changes, this will be a different function...\n\n  function handleSubmit(orderDetails) {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      {/* ... so ShippingForm's props will never be the same, and it will re-render every time */}\n\n      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn JavaScript, a function () {} or () => {} always creates a different function, similar to how the {} object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it means that ShippingForm props will never be the same, and your memo optimization won’t work. This is where useCallback comes in handy:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n\n  // Tell React to cache your function between re-renders...\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]); // ...so as long as these dependencies don't change...\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      {/* ...ShippingForm will receive the same props and can skip re-rendering */}\n\n      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nBy wrapping handleSubmit in useCallback, you ensure that it’s the same function between the re-renders (until dependencies change). You don’t have to wrap a function in useCallback unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in memo, and this lets it skip re-rendering. There are other reasons you might need useCallback which are described further on this page.\n\nNote\n\nYou should only rely on useCallback as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add useCallback back.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow is useCallback related to useMemo? \nShow Details\nDEEP DIVE\nShould you add useCallback everywhere? \nShow Details\nThe difference between useCallback and declaring a function directly\n1. Skipping re-rendering with useCallback and memo\n2. Always re-rendering a component\nExample 1 of 2: Skipping re-rendering with useCallback and memo \n\nIn this example, the ShippingForm component is artificially slowed down so that you can see what happens when a React component you’re rendering is genuinely slow. Try incrementing the counter and toggling the theme.\n\nIncrementing the counter feels slow because it forces the slowed down ShippingForm to re-render. That’s expected because the counter has changed, and so you need to reflect the user’s new choice on the screen.\n\nNext, try toggling the theme. Thanks to useCallback together with memo, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! ShippingForm skipped re-rendering because the handleSubmit function has not changed. The handleSubmit function has not changed because both productId and referrer (your useCallback dependencies) haven’t changed since last render.\n\nApp.js\nProductPage.js\nShippingForm.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport ShippingForm from './ShippingForm.js';\n\nexport default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n      referrer,\n      orderDetails,\n    });\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n  return (\n    <div className={theme}>\n      <ShippingForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction post(url, data) {\n  // Imagine this sends a request...\n  console.log('POST /' + url);\n  console.log(data);\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nUpdating state from a memoized callback \n\nSometimes, you might need to update state based on previous state from a memoized callback.\n\nThis handleAddTodo function specifies todos as a dependency because it computes the next todos from it:\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n\n\n  const handleAddTodo = useCallback((text) => {\n\n    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text };\n\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n\n  }, [todos]);\n\n  // ...\n\nYou’ll usually want memoized functions to have as few dependencies as possible. When you read some state only to calculate the next state, you can remove that dependency by passing an updater function instead:\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n\n\n  const handleAddTodo = useCallback((text) => {\n\n    const newTodo = { id: nextId++, text };\n\n    setTodos(todos => [...todos, newTodo]);\n\n  }, []); // ✅ No need for the todos dependency\n\n  // ...\n\nHere, instead of making todos a dependency and reading it inside, you pass an instruction about how to update the state (todos => [...todos, newTodo]) to React. Read more about updater functions.\n\nPreventing an Effect from firing too often \n\nSometimes, you might want to call a function from inside an Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  function createOptions() {\n\n    return {\n\n      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    // ...\n\nThis creates a problem. Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency of your Effect. However, if you declare createOptions as a dependency, it will cause your Effect to constantly reconnect to the chat room:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [createOptions]); // 🔴 Problem: This dependency changes on every render\n\n  // ...\n\nTo solve this, you can wrap the function you need to call from an Effect into useCallback:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  const createOptions = useCallback(() => {\n\n    return {\n\n      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [createOptions]); // ✅ Only changes when createOptions changes\n\n  // ...\n\nThis ensures that the createOptions function is the same between re-renders if the roomId is the same. However, it’s even better to remove the need for a function dependency. Move your function inside the Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    function createOptions() { // ✅ No need for useCallback or function dependencies!\n\n      return {\n\n        serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n        roomId: roomId\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes\n\n  // ...\n\nNow your code is simpler and doesn’t need useCallback. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.\n\nOptimizing a custom Hook \n\nIf you’re writing a custom Hook, it’s recommended to wrap any functions that it returns into useCallback:\n\nfunction useRouter() {\n\n  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);\n\n\n\n  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {\n\n    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });\n\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n\n\n  const goBack = useCallback(() => {\n\n    dispatch({ type: 'back' });\n\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n\n\n  return {\n\n    navigate,\n\n    goBack,\n\n  };\n\n}\n\nThis ensures that the consumers of your Hook can optimize their own code when needed.\n\nTroubleshooting \nEvery time my component renders, useCallback returns a different function \n\nMake sure you’ve specified the dependency array as a second argument!\n\nIf you forget the dependency array, useCallback will return a new function every time:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }); // 🔴 Returns a new function every time: no dependency array\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is the corrected version passing the dependency array as a second argument:\n\nfunction ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails,\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]); // ✅ Does not return a new function unnecessarily\n\n  // ...\n\nIf this doesn’t help, then the problem is that at least one of your dependencies is different from the previous render. You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    // ..\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n\n\n  console.log([productId, referrer]);\n\nYou can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:\n\nObject.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...\n\nWhen you find which dependency is breaking memoization, either find a way to remove it, or memoize it as well.\n\nI need to call useCallback for each list item in a loop, but it’s not allowed \n\nSuppose the Chart component is wrapped in memo. You want to skip re-rendering every Chart in the list when the ReportList component re-renders. However, you can’t call useCallback in a loop:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <article>\n\n      {items.map(item => {\n\n        // 🔴 You can't call useCallback in a loop like this:\n\n        const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n\n          sendReport(item)\n\n        }, [item]);\n\n\n\n        return (\n\n          <figure key={item.id}>\n\n            <Chart onClick={handleClick} />\n\n          </figure>\n\n        );\n\n      })}\n\n    </article>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nInstead, extract a component for an individual item, and put useCallback there:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <article>\n\n      {items.map(item =>\n\n        <Report key={item.id} item={item} />\n\n      )}\n\n    </article>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Report({ item }) {\n\n  // ✅ Call useCallback at the top level:\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n\n    sendReport(item)\n\n  }, [item]);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <figure>\n\n      <Chart onClick={handleClick} />\n\n    </figure>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, you could remove useCallback in the last snippet and instead wrap Report itself in memo. If the item prop does not change, Report will skip re-rendering, so Chart will skip re-rendering too:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst Report = memo(function Report({ item }) {\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    sendReport(item);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <figure>\n\n      <Chart onClick={handleClick} />\n\n    </figure>\n\n  );\n\n});\nPREVIOUS\nuseActionState\nNEXT\nuseContext"

The context itself does not hold the information, it only represents the kind of information you can provide or read from components.\nReturns \n\nuseContext returns the context value for the calling component. It is determined as the value passed to the closest SomeContext above the calling component in the tree. If there is no such provider, then the returned value will be the defaultValue you have passed to createContext for that context. The returned value is always up-to-date. React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes.\n\nCaveats \nuseContext() call in a component is not affected by providers returned from the same component. The corresponding <Context> needs to be above the component doing the useContext() call.\nReact automatically re-renders all the children that use a particular context starting from the provider that receives a different value. The previous and the next values are compared with the Object.is comparison. Skipping re-renders with memo does not prevent the children receiving fresh context values.\nIf your build system produces duplicates modules in the output (which can happen with symlinks), this can break context. Passing something via context only works if SomeContext that you use to provide context and SomeContext that you use to read it are exactly the same object, as determined by a === comparison.\nUsage \nPassing data deeply into the tree \n\nCall useContext at the top level of your component to read and subscribe to context.\n\nimport { useContext } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  // ...\n\nuseContext returns the context value for the context you passed. To determine the context value, React searches the component tree and finds the closest context provider above for that particular context.\n\nTo pass context to a Button, wrap it or one of its parent components into the corresponding context provider:\n\nfunction MyPage() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n\n      <Form />\n\n    </ThemeContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  // ... renders buttons inside ...\n\n}\n\nIt doesn’t matter how many layers of components there are between the provider and the Button. When a Button anywhere inside of Form calls useContext(ThemeContext), it will receive \"dark\" as the value.\n\nPitfall\n\nuseContext() always looks for the closest provider above the component that calls it. It searches upwards and does not consider providers in the component from which you’re calling useContext().\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, useContext } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n      <Form />\n    </ThemeContext>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <section className={className}>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Button({ children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'button-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <button className={className}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nUpdating data passed via context \n\nOften, you’ll want the context to change over time. To update context, combine it with state. Declare a state variable in the parent component, and pass the current state down as the context value to the provider.\n\nfunction MyPage() {\n\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark');\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n\n      <Form />\n\n      <Button onClick={() => {\n\n        setTheme('light');\n\n      }}>\n\n        Switch to light theme\n\n      </Button>\n\n    </ThemeContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNow any Button inside of the provider will receive the current theme value. If you call setTheme to update the theme value that you pass to the provider, all Button components will re-render with the new 'light' value.\n\nExamples of updating context\n1. Updating a value via context\n2. Updating an object via context\n3. Multiple contexts\n4. Extracting providers to a component\n5. Scaling up with context and a reducer\nExample 1 of 5: Updating a value via context \n\nIn this example, the MyApp component holds a state variable which is then passed to the ThemeContext provider. Checking the “Dark mode” checkbox updates the state. Changing the provided value re-renders all the components using that context.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n      <Form />\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"checkbox\"\n          checked={theme === 'dark'}\n          onChange={(e) => {\n            setTheme(e.target.checked ? 'dark' : 'light')\n          }}\n        />\n        Use dark mode\n      </label>\n    </ThemeContext>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Form({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <section className={className}>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Button({ children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'button-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <button className={className}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNote that value=\"dark\" passes the \"dark\" string, but value={theme} passes the value of the JavaScript theme variable with JSX curly braces. Curly braces also let you pass context values that aren’t strings.\n\nNext Example\nSpecifying a fallback default value \n\nIf React can’t find any providers of that particular context in the parent tree, the context value returned by useContext() will be equal to the default value that you specified when you created that context:\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nThe default value never changes. If you want to update context, use it with state as described above.\n\nOften, instead of null, there is some more meaningful value you can use as a default, for example:\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nThis way, if you accidentally render some component without a corresponding provider, it won’t break. This also helps your components work well in a test environment without setting up a lot of providers in the tests.\n\nIn the example below, the “Toggle theme” button is always light because it’s outside any theme context provider and the default context theme value is 'light'. Try editing the default theme to be 'dark'.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n        <Form />\n      </ThemeContext>\n      <Button onClick={() => {\n        setTheme(theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark');\n      }}>\n        Toggle theme\n      </Button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Form({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <section className={className}>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Button({ children, onClick }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'button-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <button className={className} onClick={onClick}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nOverriding context for a part of the tree \n\nYou can override the context for a part of the tree by wrapping that part in a provider with a different value.\n\n<ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n\n  ...\n\n  <ThemeContext value=\"light\">\n\n    <Footer />\n\n  </ThemeContext>\n\n  ...\n\n</ThemeContext>\n\nYou can nest and override providers as many times as you need.\n\nExamples of overriding context\n1. Overriding a theme\n2. Automatically nested headings\nExample 1 of 2: Overriding a theme \n\nHere, the button inside the Footer receives a different context value (\"light\") than the buttons outside (\"dark\").\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, useContext } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n      <Form />\n    </ThemeContext>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n      <ThemeContext value=\"light\">\n        <Footer />\n      </ThemeContext>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Footer() {\n  return (\n    <footer>\n      <Button>Settings</Button>\n    </footer>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <section className={className}>\n      {title && <h1>{title}</h1>}\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Button({ children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'button-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <button className={className}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nOptimizing re-renders when passing objects and functions \n\nYou can pass any values via context, including objects and functions.\n\nfunction MyApp() {\n\n  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  function login(response) {\n\n    storeCredentials(response.credentials);\n\n    setCurrentUser(response.user);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <AuthContext value={{ currentUser, login }}>\n\n      <Page />\n\n    </AuthContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nHere, the context value is a JavaScript object with two properties, one of which is a function. Whenever MyApp re-renders (for example, on a route update), this will be a different object pointing at a different function, so React will also have to re-render all components deep in the tree that call useContext(AuthContext).\n\nIn smaller apps, this is not a problem. However, there is no need to re-render them if the underlying data, like currentUser, has not changed. To help React take advantage of that fact, you may wrap the login function with useCallback and wrap the object creation into useMemo. This is a performance optimization:\n\nimport { useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction MyApp() {\n\n  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  const login = useCallback((response) => {\n\n    storeCredentials(response.credentials);\n\n    setCurrentUser(response.user);\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({\n\n    currentUser,\n\n    login\n\n  }), [currentUser, login]);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <AuthContext value={contextValue}>\n\n      <Page />\n\n    </AuthContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAs a result of this change, even if MyApp needs to re-render, the components calling useContext(AuthContext) won’t need to re-render unless currentUser has changed.\n\nRead more about useMemo and useCallback.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy component doesn’t see the value from my provider \n\nThere are a few common ways that this can happen:\n\nYou’re rendering <SomeContext> in the same component (or below) as where you’re calling useContext(). Move <SomeContext> above and outside the component calling useContext().\nYou may have forgotten to wrap your component with <SomeContext>, or you might have put it in a different part of the tree than you thought. Check whether the hierarchy is right using React DevTools.\nYou might be running into some build issue with your tooling that causes SomeContext as seen from the providing component and SomeContext as seen by the reading component to be two different objects. This can happen if you use symlinks, for example. You can verify this by assigning them to globals like window.SomeContext1 and window.SomeContext2 and then checking whether window.SomeContext1 === window.SomeContext2 in the console. If they’re not the same, fix that issue on the build tool level.\nI am always getting undefined from my context although the default value is different \n\nYou might have a provider without a value in the tree:\n\n// 🚩 Doesn't work: no value prop\n\n<ThemeContext>\n\n   <Button />\n\n</ThemeContext>\n\nIf you forget to specify value, it’s like passing value={undefined}.\n\nYou may have also mistakingly used a different prop name by mistake:\n\n// 🚩 Doesn't work: prop should be called \"value\"\n\n<ThemeContext theme={theme}>\n\n   <Button />\n\n</ThemeContext>\n\nIn both of these cases you should see a warning from React in the console. To fix them, call the prop value:\n\n// ✅ Passing the value prop\n\n<ThemeContext value={theme}>\n\n   <Button />\n\n</ThemeContext>\n\nNote that the default value from your createContext(defaultValue) call is only used if there is no matching provider above at all. If there is a <SomeContext value={undefined}> component somewhere in the parent tree, the component calling useContext(SomeContext) will receive undefined as the context value.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseCallback\nNEXT\nuseDebugValue"

It can have any type.\noptional initialValue: A value to use during the initial render of a component. If this option is omitted, useDeferredValue will not defer during the initial render, because there’s no previous version of value that it can render instead.\nReturns \ncurrentValue: During the initial render, the returned deferred value will be the initialValue, or the same as the value you provided. During updates, React will first attempt a re-render with the old value (so it will return the old value), and then try another re-render in the background with the new value (so it will return the updated value).\nCaveats \n\nWhen an update is inside a Transition, useDeferredValue always returns the new value and does not spawn a deferred render, since the update is already deferred.\n\nThe values you pass to useDeferredValue should either be primitive values (like strings and numbers) or objects created outside of rendering. If you create a new object during rendering and immediately pass it to useDeferredValue, it will be different on every render, causing unnecessary background re-renders.\n\nWhen useDeferredValue receives a different value (compared with Object.is), in addition to the current render (when it still uses the previous value), it schedules a re-render in the background with the new value. The background re-render is interruptible: if there’s another update to the value, React will restart the background re-render from scratch. For example, if the user is typing into an input faster than a chart receiving its deferred value can re-render, the chart will only re-render after the user stops typing.\n\nuseDeferredValue is integrated with <Suspense>. If the background update caused by a new value suspends the UI, the user will not see the fallback. They will see the old deferred value until the data loads.\n\nuseDeferredValue does not by itself prevent extra network requests.\n\nThere is no fixed delay caused by useDeferredValue itself. As soon as React finishes the original re-render, React will immediately start working on the background re-render with the new deferred value. Any updates caused by events (like typing) will interrupt the background re-render and get prioritized over it.\n\nThe background re-render caused by useDeferredValue does not fire Effects until it’s committed to the screen. If the background re-render suspends, its Effects will run after the data loads and the UI updates.\n\nUsage \nShowing stale content while fresh content is loading \n\nCall useDeferredValue at the top level of your component to defer updating some part of your UI.\n\nimport { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction SearchPage() {\n\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nDuring the initial render, the deferred value will be the same as the value you provided.\n\nDuring updates, the deferred value will “lag behind” the latest value. In particular, React will first re-render without updating the deferred value, and then try to re-render with the newly received value in the background.\n\nLet’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.\n\nNote\n\nThis example assumes you use a Suspense-enabled data source:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a Promise with use\n\nLearn more about Suspense and its limitations.\n\nIn this example, the SearchResults component suspends while fetching the search results. Try typing \"a\", waiting for the results, and then editing it to \"ab\". The results for \"a\" get replaced by the loading fallback.\n\nApp.js\nSearchResults.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <SearchResults query={query} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nA common alternative UI pattern is to defer updating the list of results and to keep showing the previous results until the new results are ready. Call useDeferredValue to pass a deferred version of the query down:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <label>\n\n        Search albums:\n\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n\n      </label>\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n\n        <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe query will update immediately, so the input will display the new value. However, the deferredQuery will keep its previous value until the data has loaded, so SearchResults will show the stale results for a bit.\n\nEnter \"a\" in the example below, wait for the results to load, and then edit the input to \"ab\". Notice how instead of the Suspense fallback, you now see the stale result list until the new results have loaded:\n\nApp.js\nSearchResults.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDEEP DIVE\nHow does deferring a value work under the hood? \nShow Details\nIndicating that the content is stale \n\nIn the example above, there is no indication that the result list for the latest query is still loading. This can be confusing to the user if the new results take a while to load. To make it more obvious to the user that the result list does not match the latest query, you can add a visual indication when the stale result list is displayed:\n\n<div style={{\n\n  opacity: query !== deferredQuery ? 0.5 : 1,\n\n}}>\n\n  <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n\n</div>\n\nWith this change, as soon as you start typing, the stale result list gets slightly dimmed until the new result list loads. You can also add a CSS transition to delay dimming so that it feels gradual, like in the example below:\n\nApp.js\nSearchResults.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n  const isStale = query !== deferredQuery;\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <div style={{\n          opacity: isStale ? 0.5 : 1,\n          transition: isStale ? 'opacity 0.2s 0.2s linear' : 'opacity 0s 0s linear'\n        }}>\n          <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n        </div>\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDeferring re-rendering for a part of the UI \n\nYou can also apply useDeferredValue as a performance optimization. It is useful when a part of your UI is slow to re-render, there’s no easy way to optimize it, and you want to prevent it from blocking the rest of the UI.\n\nImagine you have a text field and a component (like a chart or a long list) that re-renders on every keystroke:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />\n\n      <SlowList text={text} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nFirst, optimize SlowList to skip re-rendering when its props are the same. To do this, wrap it in memo:\n\nconst SlowList = memo(function SlowList({ text }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nHowever, this only helps if the SlowList props are the same as during the previous render. The problem you’re facing now is that it’s slow when they’re different, and when you actually need to show different visual output.\n\nConcretely, the main performance problem is that whenever you type into the input, the SlowList receives new props, and re-rendering its entire tree makes the typing feel janky. In this case, useDeferredValue lets you prioritize updating the input (which must be fast) over updating the result list (which is allowed to be slower):\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text);\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />\n\n      <SlowList text={deferredText} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis does not make re-rendering of the SlowList faster. However, it tells React that re-rendering the list can be deprioritized so that it doesn’t block the keystrokes. The list will “lag behind” the input and then “catch up”. Like before, React will attempt to update the list as soon as possible, but will not block the user from typing.\n\nThe difference between useDeferredValue and unoptimized re-rendering\n1. Deferred re-rendering of the list\n2. Unoptimized re-rendering of the list\nExample 1 of 2: Deferred re-rendering of the list \n\nIn this example, each item in the SlowList component is artificially slowed down so that you can see how useDeferredValue lets you keep the input responsive. Type into the input and notice that typing feels snappy while the list “lags behind” it.\n\nApp.js\nSlowList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\nimport SlowList from './SlowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n  const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />\n      <SlowList text={deferredText} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nNext Example\nPitfall\n\nThis optimization requires SlowList to be wrapped in memo. This is because whenever the text changes, React needs to be able to re-render the parent component quickly. During that re-render, deferredText still has its previous value, so SlowList is able to skip re-rendering (its props have not changed). Without memo, it would have to re-render anyway, defeating the point of the optimization.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow is deferring a value different from debouncing and throttling? \nShow Details\nPREVIOUS\nuseDebugValue\nNEXT\nuseEffect"

Your setup function may also optionally return a cleanup function. When your component is added to the DOM, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. After your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.\n\noptional dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the setup code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. If you omit this argument, your Effect will re-run after every re-render of the component. See the difference between passing an array of dependencies, an empty array, and no dependencies at all.\n\nReturns \n\nuseEffect returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \n\nuseEffect is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.\n\nIf you’re not trying to synchronize with some external system, you probably don’t need an Effect.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function.\n\nIf some of your dependencies are objects or functions defined inside the component, there is a risk that they will cause the Effect to re-run more often than needed. To fix this, remove unnecessary object and function dependencies. You can also extract state updates and non-reactive logic outside of your Effect.\n\nIf your Effect wasn’t caused by an interaction (like a click), React will generally let the browser paint the updated screen first before running your Effect. If your Effect is doing something visual (for example, positioning a tooltip), and the delay is noticeable (for example, it flickers), replace useEffect with useLayoutEffect.\n\nIf your Effect is caused by an interaction (like a click), React may run your Effect before the browser paints the updated screen. This ensures that the result of the Effect can be observed by the event system. Usually, this works as expected. However, if you must defer the work until after paint, such as an alert(), you can use setTimeout. See reactwg/react-18/128 for more information.\n\nEven if your Effect was caused by an interaction (like a click), React may allow the browser to repaint the screen before processing the state updates inside your Effect. Usually, this works as expected. However, if you must block the browser from repainting the screen, you need to replace useEffect with useLayoutEffect.\n\nEffects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.\n\nUsage \nConnecting to an external system \n\nSome components need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, while they are displayed on the page. These systems aren’t controlled by React, so they are called external.\n\nTo connect your component to some external system, call useEffect at the top level of your component:\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n  \tconst connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n  \treturn () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n  \t};\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nYou need to pass two arguments to useEffect:\n\nA setup function with setup code that connects to that system.\nIt should return a cleanup function with cleanup code that disconnects from that system.\nA list of dependencies including every value from your component used inside of those functions.\n\nReact calls your setup and cleanup functions whenever it’s necessary, which may happen multiple times:\n\nYour setup code runs when your component is added to the page (mounts).\nAfter every re-render of your component where the dependencies have changed:\nFirst, your cleanup code runs with the old props and state.\nThen, your setup code runs with the new props and state.\nYour cleanup code runs one final time after your component is removed from the page (unmounts).\n\nLet’s illustrate this sequence for the example above.\n\nWhen the ChatRoom component above gets added to the page, it will connect to the chat room with the initial serverUrl and roomId. If either serverUrl or roomId change as a result of a re-render (say, if the user picks a different chat room in a dropdown), your Effect will disconnect from the previous room, and connect to the next one. When the ChatRoom component is removed from the page, your Effect will disconnect one last time.\n\nTo help you find bugs, in development React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the setup. This is a stress-test that verifies your Effect’s logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as in development). See common solutions.\n\nTry to write every Effect as an independent process and think about a single setup/cleanup cycle at a time. It shouldn’t matter whether your component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. When your cleanup logic correctly “mirrors” the setup logic, your Effect is resilient to running setup and cleanup as often as needed.\n\nNote\n\nAn Effect lets you keep your component synchronized with some external system (like a chat service). Here, external system means any piece of code that’s not controlled by React, such as:\n\nA timer managed with setInterval() and clearInterval().\nAn event subscription using window.addEventListener() and window.removeEventListener().\nA third-party animation library with an API like animation.start() and animation.reset().\n\nIf you’re not connecting to any external system, you probably don’t need an Effect.\n\nExamples of connecting to an external system\n1. Connecting to a chat server\n2. Listening to a global browser event\n3. Triggering an animation\n4. Controlling a modal dialog\n5. Tracking element visibility\nExample 1 of 5: Connecting to a chat server \n\nIn this example, the ChatRoom component uses an Effect to stay connected to an external system defined in chat.js. Press “Open chat” to make the ChatRoom component appear. This sandbox runs in development mode, so there is an extra connect-and-disconnect cycle, as explained here. Try changing the roomId and serverUrl using the dropdown and the input, and see how the Effect re-connects to the chat. Press “Close chat” to see the Effect disconnect one last time.\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => {\n      connection.disconnect();\n    };\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}\n      </button>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nWrapping Effects in custom Hooks \n\nEffects are an “escape hatch”: you use them when you need to “step outside React” and when there is no better built-in solution for your use case. If you find yourself often needing to manually write Effects, it’s usually a sign that you need to extract some custom Hooks for common behaviors your components rely on.\n\nFor example, this useChatRoom custom Hook “hides” the logic of your Effect behind a more declarative API:\n\nfunction useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = {\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n\n}\n\nThen you can use it from any component like this:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n\n\n  useChatRoom({\n\n    roomId: roomId,\n\n    serverUrl: serverUrl\n\n  });\n\n  // ...\n\nThere are also many excellent custom Hooks for every purpose available in the React ecosystem.\n\nLearn more about wrapping Effects in custom Hooks.\n\nExamples of wrapping Effects in custom Hooks\n1. Custom useChatRoom Hook\n2. Custom useWindowListener Hook\n3. Custom useIntersectionObserver Hook\nExample 1 of 3: Custom useChatRoom Hook \n\nThis example is identical to one of the earlier examples, but the logic is extracted to a custom Hook.\n\nApp.js\nuseChatRoom.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useChatRoom } from './useChatRoom.js';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useChatRoom({\n    roomId: roomId,\n    serverUrl: serverUrl\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}\n      </button>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nControlling a non-React widget \n\nSometimes, you want to keep an external system synchronized to some prop or state of your component.\n\nFor example, if you have a third-party map widget or a video player component written without React, you can use an Effect to call methods on it that make its state match the current state of your React component. This Effect creates an instance of a MapWidget class defined in map-widget.js. When you change the zoomLevel prop of the Map component, the Effect calls the setZoom() on the class instance to keep it synchronized:\n\nApp.js\nMap.js\nmap-widget.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { MapWidget } from './map-widget.js';\n\nexport default function Map({ zoomLevel }) {\n  const containerRef = useRef(null);\n  const mapRef = useRef(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (mapRef.current === null) {\n      mapRef.current = new MapWidget(containerRef.current);\n    }\n\n    const map = mapRef.current;\n    map.setZoom(zoomLevel);\n  }, [zoomLevel]);\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}\n      ref={containerRef}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn this example, a cleanup function is not needed because the MapWidget class manages only the DOM node that was passed to it. After the Map React component is removed from the tree, both the DOM node and the MapWidget class instance will be automatically garbage-collected by the browser JavaScript engine.\n\nFetching data with Effects \n\nYou can use an Effect to fetch data for your component. Note that if you use a framework, using your framework’s data fetching mechanism will be a lot more efficient than writing Effects manually.\n\nIf you want to fetch data from an Effect manually, your code might look like this:\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nimport { fetchBio } from './api.js';\n\n\n\nexport default function Page() {\n\n  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');\n\n  const [bio, setBio] = useState(null);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    let ignore = false;\n\n    setBio(null);\n\n    fetchBio(person).then(result => {\n\n      if (!ignore) {\n\n        setBio(result);\n\n      }\n\n    });\n\n    return () => {\n\n      ignore = true;\n\n    };\n\n  }, [person]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\nNote the ignore variable which is initialized to false, and is set to true during cleanup. This ensures your code doesn’t suffer from “race conditions”: network responses may arrive in a different order than you sent them.\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { fetchBio } from './api.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');\n  const [bio, setBio] = useState(null);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    let ignore = false;\n    setBio(null);\n    fetchBio(person).then(result => {\n      if (!ignore) {\n        setBio(result);\n      }\n    });\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    }\n  }, [person]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <select value={person} onChange={e => {\n        setPerson(e.target.value);\n      }}>\n        <option value=\"Alice\">Alice</option>\n        <option value=\"Bob\">Bob</option>\n        <option value=\"Taylor\">Taylor</option>\n      </select>\n      <hr />\n      <p><i>{bio ?? 'Loading...'}</i></p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nYou can also rewrite using the async / await syntax, but you still need to provide a cleanup function:\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { fetchBio } from './api.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');\n  const [bio, setBio] = useState(null);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    async function startFetching() {\n      setBio(null);\n      const result = await fetchBio(person);\n      if (!ignore) {\n        setBio(result);\n      }\n    }\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    startFetching();\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    }\n  }, [person]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <select value={person} onChange={e => {\n        setPerson(e.target.value);\n      }}>\n        <option value=\"Alice\">Alice</option>\n        <option value=\"Bob\">Bob</option>\n        <option value=\"Taylor\">Taylor</option>\n      </select>\n      <hr />\n      <p><i>{bio ??

It’s easier to use a custom Hook—either your own or maintained by the community.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhat are good alternatives to data fetching in Effects? \nShow Details\nSpecifying reactive dependencies \n\nNotice that you can’t “choose” the dependencies of your Effect. Every reactive value used by your Effect’s code must be declared as a dependency. Your Effect’s dependency list is determined by the surrounding code:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) { // This is a reactive value\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234'); // This is a reactive value too\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId); // This Effect reads these reactive values\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]); // ✅ So you must specify them as dependencies of your Effect\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIf either serverUrl or roomId change, your Effect will reconnect to the chat using the new values.\n\nReactive values include props and all variables and functions declared directly inside of your component. Since roomId and serverUrl are reactive values, you can’t remove them from the dependencies. If you try to omit them and your linter is correctly configured for React, the linter will flag this as a mistake you need to fix:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  \n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'roomId' and 'serverUrl'\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nTo remove a dependency, you need to “prove” to the linter that it doesn’t need to be a dependency. For example, you can move serverUrl out of your component to prove that it’s not reactive and won’t change on re-renders:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // Not a reactive value anymore\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNow that serverUrl is not a reactive value (and can’t change on a re-render), it doesn’t need to be a dependency. If your Effect’s code doesn’t use any reactive values, its dependency list should be empty ([]):\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234'; // Not a reactive value anymore\n\nconst roomId = 'music'; // Not a reactive value anymore\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom() {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, []); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nAn Effect with empty dependencies doesn’t re-run when any of your component’s props or state change.\n\nPitfall\n\nIf you have an existing codebase, you might have some Effects that suppress the linter like this:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // ...\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid suppressing the linter like this:\n\n  // eslint-ignore-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\n\n}, []);\n\nWhen dependencies don’t match the code, there is a high risk of introducing bugs. By suppressing the linter, you “lie” to React about the values your Effect depends on. Instead, prove they’re unnecessary.\n\nExamples of passing reactive dependencies\n1. Passing a dependency array\n2. Passing an empty dependency array\n3. Passing no dependency array at all\nExample 1 of 3: Passing a dependency array \n\nIf you specify the dependencies, your Effect runs after the initial render and after re-renders with changed dependencies.\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // ...\n\n}, [a, b]); // Runs again if a or b are different\n\nIn the below example, serverUrl and roomId are reactive values, so they both must be specified as dependencies. As a result, selecting a different room in the dropdown or editing the server URL input causes the chat to re-connect. However, since message isn’t used in the Effect (and so it isn’t a dependency), editing the message doesn’t re-connect to the chat.\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => {\n      connection.disconnect();\n    };\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n      <label>\n        Your message:{' '}\n        <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n        <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n          {show ? 'Close chat' : 'Open chat'}\n        </button>\n      </label>\n      {show && <hr />}\n      {show && <ChatRoom roomId={roomId}/>}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nUpdating state based on previous state from an Effect \n\nWhen you want to update state based on previous state from an Effect, you might run into a problem:\n\nfunction Counter() {\n\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {\n\n      setCount(count + 1); // You want to increment the counter every second...\n\n    }, 1000)\n\n    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);\n\n  }, [count]); // 🚩 ... but specifying `count` as a dependency always resets the interval.\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSince count is a reactive value, it must be specified in the list of dependencies. However, that causes the Effect to cleanup and setup again every time the count changes. This is not ideal.\n\nTo fix this, pass the c => c + 1 state updater to setCount:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {\n      setCount(c => c + 1); // ✅ Pass a state updater\n    }, 1000);\n    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);\n  }, []); // ✅ Now count is not a dependency\n\n  return <h1>{count}</h1>;\n}\n\n\n\nNow that you’re passing c => c + 1 instead of count + 1, your Effect no longer needs to depend on count. As a result of this fix, it won’t need to cleanup and setup the interval again every time the count changes.\n\nRemoving unnecessary object dependencies \n\nIf your Effect depends on an object or a function created during rendering, it might run too often. For example, this Effect re-connects after every render because the options object is different for every render:\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  const options = { // 🚩 This object is created from scratch on every re-render\n\n    serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n    roomId: roomId\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options); // It's used inside the Effect\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [options]); // 🚩 As a result, these dependencies are always different on a re-render\n\n  // ...\n\nAvoid using an object created during rendering as a dependency. Instead, create the object inside the Effect:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const options = {\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n      roomId: roomId\n    };\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNow that you create the options object inside the Effect, the Effect itself only depends on the roomId string.\n\nWith this fix, typing into the input doesn’t reconnect the chat. Unlike an object which gets re-created, a string like roomId doesn’t change unless you set it to another value. Read more about removing dependencies.\n\nRemoving unnecessary function dependencies \n\nIf your Effect depends on an object or a function created during rendering, it might run too often. For example, this Effect re-connects after every render because the createOptions function is different for every render:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  function createOptions() { // 🚩 This function is created from scratch on every re-render\n\n    return {\n\n      serverUrl: serverUrl,\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = createOptions(); // It's used inside the Effect\n\n    const connection = createConnection();\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [createOptions]); // 🚩 As a result, these dependencies are always different on a re-render\n\n  // ...\n\nBy itself, creating a function from scratch on every re-render is not a problem. You don’t need to optimize that. However, if you use it as a dependency of your Effect, it will cause your Effect to re-run after every re-render.\n\nAvoid using a function created during rendering as a dependency. Instead, declare it inside the Effect:\n\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nconst serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    function createOptions() {\n      return {\n        serverUrl: serverUrl,\n        roomId: roomId\n      };\n    }\n\n    const options = createOptions();\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n      <input value={message} onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom roomId={roomId} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNow that you define the createOptions function inside the Effect, the Effect itself only depends on the roomId string. With this fix, typing into the input doesn’t reconnect the chat. Unlike a function which gets re-created, a string like roomId doesn’t change unless you set it to another value. Read more about removing dependencies.\n\nReading the latest props and state from an Effect \n\nBy default, when you read a reactive value from an Effect, you have to add it as a dependency. This ensures that your Effect “reacts” to every change of that value. For most dependencies, that’s the behavior you want.\n\nHowever, sometimes you’ll want to read the latest props and state from an Effect without “reacting” to them. For example, imagine you want to log the number of the items in the shopping cart for every page visit:\n\nfunction Page({ url, shoppingCart }) {\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    logVisit(url, shoppingCart.length);\n\n  }, [url, shoppingCart]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nWhat if you want to log a new page visit after every url change, but not if only the shoppingCart changes? You can’t exclude shoppingCart from dependencies without breaking the reactivity rules. However, you can express that you don’t want a piece of code to “react” to changes even though it is called from inside an Effect. Declare an Effect Event with the useEffectEvent Hook, and move the code reading shoppingCart inside of it:\n\nfunction Page({ url, shoppingCart }) {\n\n  const onVisit = useEffectEvent(visitedUrl => {\n\n    logVisit(visitedUrl, shoppingCart.length)\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    onVisit(url);\n\n  }, [url]); // ✅ All dependencies declared\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nEffect Events are not reactive and must always be omitted from dependencies of your Effect. This is what lets you put non-reactive code (where you can read the latest value of some props and state) inside of them. By reading shoppingCart inside of onVisit, you ensure that shoppingCart won’t re-run your Effect.\n\nRead more about how Effect Events let you separate reactive and non-reactive code.\n\nDisplaying different content on the server and the client \n\nIf your app uses server rendering (either directly or via a framework), your component will render in two different environments. On the server, it will render to produce the initial HTML. On the client, React will run the rendering code again so that it can attach your event handlers to that HTML. This is why, for hydration to work, your initial render output must be identical on the client and the server.\n\nIn rare cases, you might need to display different content on the client. For example, if your app reads some data from localStorage, it can’t possibly do that on the server. Here is how you could implement this:\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const [didMount, setDidMount] = useState(false);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    setDidMount(true);\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  if (didMount) {\n\n    // ... return client-only JSX ...\n\n  }  else {\n\n    // ... return initial JSX ...\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nWhile the app is loading, the user will see the initial render output. Then, when it’s loaded and hydrated, your Effect will run and set didMount to true, triggering a re-render. This will switch to the client-only render output. Effects don’t run on the server, so this is why didMount was false during the initial server render.\n\nUse this pattern sparingly. Keep in mind that users with a slow connection will see the initial content for quite a bit of time—potentially, many seconds—so you don’t want to make jarring changes to your component’s appearance. In many cases, you can avoid the need for this by conditionally showing different things with CSS.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy Effect runs twice when the component mounts \n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, in development, React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the actual setup.\n\nThis is a stress-test that verifies your Effect’s logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing. The rule of thumb is that the user shouldn’t be able to distinguish between the setup being called once (as in production) and a setup → cleanup → setup sequence (as in development).\n\nRead more about how this helps find bugs and how to fix your logic.\n\nMy Effect runs after every re-render \n\nFirst, check that you haven’t forgotten to specify the dependency array:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // ...\n\n}); // 🚩 No dependency array: re-runs after every render!\n\nIf you’ve specified the dependency array but your Effect still re-runs in a loop, it’s because one of your dependencies is different on every re-render.\n\nYou can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    // ..\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\n\n\n  console.log([serverUrl, roomId]);\n\nYou can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:\n\nObject.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...\n\nWhen you find the dependency that is different on every re-render, you can usually fix it in one of these ways:\n\nUpdating state based on previous state from an Effect\nRemoving unnecessary object dependencies\nRemoving unnecessary function dependencies\nReading the latest props and state from an Effect\n\nAs a last resort (if these methods didn’t help), wrap its creation with useMemo or useCallback (for functions).\n\nMy Effect keeps re-running in an infinite cycle \n\nIf your Effect runs in an infinite cycle, these two things must be true:\n\nYour Effect is updating some state.\nThat state leads to a re-render, which causes the Effect’s dependencies to change.\n\nBefore you start fixing the problem, ask yourself whether your Effect is connecting to some external system (like DOM, network, a third-party widget, and so on). Why does your Effect need to set state? Does it synchronize with that external system? Or are you trying to manage your application’s data flow with it?\n\nIf there is no external system, consider whether removing the Effect altogether would simplify your logic.\n\nIf you’re genuinely synchronizing with some external system, think about why and under what conditions your Effect should update the state. Has something changed that affects your component’s visual output? If you need to keep track of some data that isn’t used by rendering, a ref (which doesn’t trigger re-renders) might be more appropriate. Verify your Effect doesn’t update the state (and trigger re-renders) more than needed.\n\nFinally, if your Effect is updating the state at the right time, but there is still a loop, it’s because that state update leads to one of the Effect’s dependencies changing. Read how to debug dependency changes.\n\nMy cleanup logic runs even though my component didn’t unmount \n\nThe cleanup function runs not only during unmount, but before every re-render with changed dependencies. Additionally, in development, React runs setup+cleanup one extra time immediately after component mounts.\n\nIf you have cleanup code without corresponding setup code, it’s usually a code smell:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: Cleanup logic without corresponding setup logic\n\n  return () => {\n\n    doSomething();\n\n  };\n\n}, []);\n\nYour cleanup logic should be “symmetrical” to the setup logic, and should stop or undo whatever setup did:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\nLearn how the Effect lifecycle is different from the component’s lifecycle.\n\nMy Effect does something visual, and I see a flicker before it runs \n\nIf your Effect must block the browser from painting the screen, replace useEffect with useLayoutEffect. Note that this shouldn’t be needed for the vast majority of Effects. You’ll only need this if it’s crucial to run your Effect before the browser paint: for example, to measure and position a tooltip before the user sees it.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseDeferredValue\nNEXT\nuseEffectEvent"

Effect Events are functions you can call inside Effects, such as useEffect:\n\nimport { useEffectEvent, useEffect } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {\n\n  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {\n\n    showNotification('Connected!', theme);\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.on('connected', () => {\n\n      onConnected();\n\n    });\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \ncallback: A function containing the logic for your Effect Event. When you define an Effect Event with useEffectEvent, the callback always accesses the latest values from props and state when it is invoked. This helps avoid issues with stale closures.\nReturns \n\nReturns an Effect Event function. You can call this function inside useEffect, useLayoutEffect, or useInsertionEffect.\n\nCaveats \nOnly call inside Effects: Effect Events should only be called within Effects. Define them just before the Effect that uses them. Do not pass them to other components or hooks. The eslint-plugin-react-hooks linter (version 6.1.1 or higher) will enforce this restriction to prevent calling Effect Events in the wrong context.\nNot a dependency shortcut: Do not use useEffectEvent to avoid specifying dependencies in your Effect’s dependency array. This can hide bugs and make your code harder to understand. Prefer explicit dependencies or use refs to compare previous values if needed.\nUse for non-reactive logic: Only use useEffectEvent to extract logic that does not depend on changing values.\nUsage \nReading the latest props and state \n\nTypically, when you access a reactive value inside an Effect, you must include it in the dependency array. This makes sure your Effect runs again whenever that value changes, which is usually the desired behavior.\n\nBut in some cases, you may want to read the most recent props or state inside an Effect without causing the Effect to re-run when those values change.\n\nTo read the latest props or state in your Effect, without making those values reactive, include them in an Effect Event.\n\nimport { useEffect, useContext, useEffectEvent } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Page({ url }) {\n\n  const { items } = useContext(ShoppingCartContext);\n\n  const numberOfItems = items.length;\n\n\n\n  const onNavigate = useEffectEvent((visitedUrl) => {\n\n    logVisit(visitedUrl, numberOfItems);\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    onNavigate(url);\n\n  }, [url]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIn this example, the Effect should re-run after a render when url changes (to log the new page visit), but it should not re-run when numberOfItems changes. By wrapping the logging logic in an Effect Event, numberOfItems becomes non-reactive. It’s always read from the latest value without triggering the Effect.\n\nYou can pass reactive values like url as arguments to the Effect Event to keep them reactive while accessing the latest non-reactive values inside the event.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseEffect\nNEXT\nuseId"

For example, you can specify that an element (like an input) is described by another element (like a paragraph).\n\nIn regular HTML, you would write it like this:\n\n<label>\n\n  Password:\n\n  <input\n\n    type=\"password\"\n\n    aria-describedby=\"password-hint\"\n\n  />\n\n</label>\n\n<p id=\"password-hint\">\n\n  The password should contain at least 18 characters\n\n</p>\n\nHowever, hardcoding IDs like this is not a good practice in React.

That ref handle can have any type. Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose.\n\noptional dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the createHandle code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. If a re-render resulted in a change to some dependency, or if you omitted this argument, your createHandle function will re-execute, and the newly created handle will be assigned to the ref.\n\nNote\n\nStarting with React 19, ref is available as a prop. In React 18 and earlier, it was necessary to get the ref from forwardRef.\n\nReturns \n\nuseImperativeHandle returns undefined.\n\nUsage \nExposing a custom ref handle to the parent component \n\nTo expose a DOM node to the parent element, pass in the ref prop to the node.\n\nfunction MyInput({ ref }) {\n\n  return <input ref={ref} />;\n\n};\n\nWith the code above, a ref to MyInput will receive the <input> DOM node. However, you can expose a custom value instead. To customize the exposed handle, call useImperativeHandle at the top level of your component:\n\nimport { useImperativeHandle } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction MyInput({ ref }) {\n\n  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {\n\n    return {\n\n      // ... your methods ...\n\n    };\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return <input />;\n\n};\n\nNote that in the code above, the ref is no longer passed to the <input>.\n\nFor example, suppose you don’t want to expose the entire <input> DOM node, but you want to expose two of its methods: focus and scrollIntoView. To do this, keep the real browser DOM in a separate ref. Then use useImperativeHandle to expose a handle with only the methods that you want the parent component to call:\n\nimport { useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction MyInput({ ref }) {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {\n\n    return {\n\n      focus() {\n\n        inputRef.current.focus();\n\n      },\n\n      scrollIntoView() {\n\n        inputRef.current.scrollIntoView();\n\n      },\n\n    };\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return <input ref={inputRef} />;\n\n};\n\nNow, if the parent component gets a ref to MyInput, it will be able to call the focus and scrollIntoView methods on it. However, it will not have full access to the underlying <input> DOM node.\n\nApp.js\nMyInput.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport MyInput from './MyInput.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current.focus();\n    // This won't work because the DOM node isn't exposed:\n    // ref.current.style.opacity = 0.5;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <MyInput placeholder=\"Enter your name\" ref={ref} />\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n        Edit\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nExposing your own imperative methods \n\nThe methods you expose via an imperative handle don’t have to match the DOM methods exactly. For example, this Post component exposes a scrollAndFocusAddComment method via an imperative handle. This lets the parent Page scroll the list of comments and focus the input field when you click the button:\n\nApp.js\nPost.js\nCommentList.js\nAddComment.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport Post from './Post.js';\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const postRef = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    postRef.current.scrollAndFocusAddComment();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Write a comment\n      </button>\n      <Post ref={postRef} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nDo not overuse refs. You should only use refs for imperative behaviors that you can’t express as props: for example, scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, and so on.\n\nIf you can express something as a prop, you should not use a ref. For example, instead of exposing an imperative handle like { open, close } from a Modal component, it is better to take isOpen as a prop like <Modal isOpen={isOpen} />. Effects can help you expose imperative behaviors via props.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseId\nNEXT\nuseInsertionEffect"

Your setup function may also optionally return a cleanup function. When your component is added to the DOM, but before any layout Effects fire, React will run your setup function.

You shouldn’t rely on the DOM being updated at any particular time.\nUnlike other types of Effects, which fire cleanup for every Effect and then setup for every Effect, useInsertionEffect will fire both cleanup and setup one component at a time. This results in an “interleaving” of the cleanup and setup functions.\nUsage \nInjecting dynamic styles from CSS-in-JS libraries \n\nTraditionally, you would style React components using plain CSS.\n\n// In your JS file:\n\n<button className=\"success\" />\n\n\n\n// In your CSS file:\n\n.success { color: green; }\n\nSome teams prefer to author styles directly in JavaScript code instead of writing CSS files. This usually requires using a CSS-in-JS library or a tool. There are three common approaches to CSS-in-JS:\n\nStatic extraction to CSS files with a compiler\nInline styles, e.g. <div style={{ opacity: 1 }}>\nRuntime injection of <style> tags\n\nIf you use CSS-in-JS, we recommend a combination of the first two approaches (CSS files for static styles, inline styles for dynamic styles). We don’t recommend runtime <style> tag injection for two reasons:\n\nRuntime injection forces the browser to recalculate the styles a lot more often.\nRuntime injection can be very slow if it happens at the wrong time in the React lifecycle.\n\nThe first problem is not solvable, but useInsertionEffect helps you solve the second problem.\n\nCall useInsertionEffect to insert the styles before any layout Effects fire:\n\n// Inside your CSS-in-JS library\n\nlet isInserted = new Set();\n\nfunction useCSS(rule) {\n\n  useInsertionEffect(() => {\n\n    // As explained earlier, we don't recommend runtime injection of <style> tags.\n\n    // But if you have to do it, then it's important to do in useInsertionEffect.\n\n    if (!isInserted.has(rule)) {\n\n      isInserted.add(rule);\n\n      document.head.appendChild(getStyleForRule(rule));\n\n    }\n\n  });\n\n  return rule;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const className = useCSS('...');\n\n  return <div className={className} />;\n\n}\n\nSimilarly to useEffect, useInsertionEffect does not run on the server. If you need to collect which CSS rules have been used on the server, you can do it during rendering:\n\nlet collectedRulesSet = new Set();\n\n\n\nfunction useCSS(rule) {\n\n  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {\n\n    collectedRulesSet.add(rule);\n\n  }\n\n  useInsertionEffect(() => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  });\n\n  return rule;\n\n}\n\nRead more about upgrading CSS-in-JS libraries with runtime injection to useInsertionEffect.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow is this better than injecting styles during rendering or useLayoutEffect? \nShow Details\nPREVIOUS\nuseImperativeHandle\nNEXT\nuseLayoutEffect"

You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a component and move the Effect there.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function.\n\nIf some of your dependencies are objects or functions defined inside the component, there is a risk that they will cause the Effect to re-run more often than needed. To fix this, remove unnecessary object and function dependencies. You can also extract state updates and non-reactive logic outside of your Effect.\n\nEffects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.\n\nThe code inside useLayoutEffect and all state updates scheduled from it block the browser from repainting the screen. When used excessively, this makes your app slow. When possible, prefer useEffect.\n\nIf you trigger a state update inside useLayoutEffect, React will execute all remaining Effects immediately including useEffect.\n\nUsage \nMeasuring layout before the browser repaints the screen \n\nMost components don’t need to know their position and size on the screen to decide what to render. They only return some JSX. Then the browser calculates their layout (position and size) and repaints the screen.\n\nSometimes, that’s not enough. Imagine a tooltip that appears next to some element on hover. If there’s enough space, the tooltip should appear above the element, but if it doesn’t fit, it should appear below. In order to render the tooltip at the right final position, you need to know its height (i.e. whether it fits at the top).\n\nTo do this, you need to render in two passes:\n\nRender the tooltip anywhere (even with a wrong position).\nMeasure its height and decide where to place the tooltip.\nRender the tooltip again in the correct place.\n\nAll of this needs to happen before the browser repaints the screen. You don’t want the user to see the tooltip moving. Call useLayoutEffect to perform the layout measurements before the browser repaints the screen:\n\nfunction Tooltip() {\n\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  const [tooltipHeight, setTooltipHeight] = useState(0); // You don't know real height yet\n\n\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n\n    const { height } = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect();\n\n    setTooltipHeight(height); // Re-render now that you know the real height\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  // ...use tooltipHeight in the rendering logic below...\n\n}\n\nHere’s how this works step by step:\n\nTooltip renders with the initial tooltipHeight = 0 (so the tooltip may be wrongly positioned).\nReact places it in the DOM and runs the code in useLayoutEffect.\nYour useLayoutEffect measures the height of the tooltip content and triggers an immediate re-render.\nTooltip renders again with the real tooltipHeight (so the tooltip is correctly positioned).\nReact updates it in the DOM, and the browser finally displays the tooltip.\n\nHover over the buttons below and see how the tooltip adjusts its position depending on whether it fits:\n\nApp.js\nButtonWithTooltip.js\nTooltip.js\nTooltipContainer.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef, useLayoutEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\nimport TooltipContainer from './TooltipContainer.js';\n\nexport default function Tooltip({ children, targetRect }) {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n  const [tooltipHeight, setTooltipHeight] = useState(0);\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n    const { height } = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect();\n    setTooltipHeight(height);\n    console.log('Measured tooltip height: ' + height);\n  }, []);\n\n  let tooltipX = 0;\n  let tooltipY = 0;\n  if (targetRect !== null) {\n    tooltipX = targetRect.left;\n    tooltipY = targetRect.top - tooltipHeight;\n    if (tooltipY < 0) {\n      // It doesn't fit above, so place below.\n      tooltipY = targetRect.bottom;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return createPortal(\n    <TooltipContainer x={tooltipX} y={tooltipY} contentRef={ref}>\n      {children}\n    </TooltipContainer>,\n    document.body\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice that even though the Tooltip component has to render in two passes (first, with tooltipHeight initialized to 0 and then with the real measured height), you only see the final result. This is why you need useLayoutEffect instead of useEffect for this example. Let’s look at the difference in detail below.\n\nuseLayoutEffect vs useEffect\n1. useLayoutEffect blocks the browser from repainting\n2. useEffect does not block the browser\nExample 1 of 2: useLayoutEffect blocks the browser from repainting \n\nReact guarantees that the code inside useLayoutEffect and any state updates scheduled inside it will be processed before the browser repaints the screen. This lets you render the tooltip, measure it, and re-render the tooltip again without the user noticing the first extra render. In other words, useLayoutEffect blocks the browser from painting.\n\nApp.js\nButtonWithTooltip.js\nTooltip.js\nTooltipContainer.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef, useLayoutEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { createPortal } from 'react-dom';\nimport TooltipContainer from './TooltipContainer.js';\n\nexport default function Tooltip({ children, targetRect }) {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n  const [tooltipHeight, setTooltipHeight] = useState(0);\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n    const { height } = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect();\n    setTooltipHeight(height);\n  }, []);\n\n  let tooltipX = 0;\n  let tooltipY = 0;\n  if (targetRect !== null) {\n    tooltipX = targetRect.left;\n    tooltipY = targetRect.top - tooltipHeight;\n    if (tooltipY < 0) {\n      // It doesn't fit above, so place below.\n      tooltipY = targetRect.bottom;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return createPortal(\n    <TooltipContainer x={tooltipX} y={tooltipY} contentRef={ref}>\n      {children}\n    </TooltipContainer>,\n    document.body\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nNote\n\nRendering in two passes and blocking the browser hurts performance. Try to avoid this when you can.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI’m getting an error: “useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server” \n\nThe purpose of useLayoutEffect is to let your component use layout information for rendering:\n\nRender the initial content.\nMeasure the layout before the browser repaints the screen.\nRender the final content using the layout information you’ve read.\n\nWhen you or your framework uses server rendering, your React app renders to HTML on the server for the initial render. This lets you show the initial HTML before the JavaScript code loads.\n\nThe problem is that on the server, there is no layout information.\n\nIn the earlier example, the useLayoutEffect call in the Tooltip component lets it position itself correctly (either above or below content) depending on the content height. If you tried to render Tooltip as a part of the initial server HTML, this would be impossible to determine. On the server, there is no layout yet! So, even if you rendered it on the server, its position would “jump” on the client after the JavaScript loads and runs.\n\nUsually, components that rely on layout information don’t need to render on the server anyway. For example, it probably doesn’t make sense to show a Tooltip during the initial render. It is triggered by a client interaction.\n\nHowever, if you’re running into this problem, you have a few different options:\n\nReplace useLayoutEffect with useEffect. This tells React that it’s okay to display the initial render result without blocking the paint (because the original HTML will become visible before your Effect runs).\n\nAlternatively, mark your component as client-only. This tells React to replace its content up to the closest <Suspense> boundary with a loading fallback (for example, a spinner or a glimmer) during server rendering.\n\nAlternatively, you can render a component with useLayoutEffect only after hydration. Keep a boolean isMounted state that’s initialized to false, and set it to true inside a useEffect call. Your rendering logic can then be like return isMounted ? <RealContent /> : <FallbackContent />. On the server and during the hydration, the user will see FallbackContent which should not call useLayoutEffect. Then React will replace it with RealContent which runs on the client only and can include useLayoutEffect calls.\n\nIf you synchronize your component with an external data store and rely on useLayoutEffect for different reasons than measuring layout, consider useSyncExternalStore instead which supports server rendering.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseInsertionEffect\nNEXT\nuseMemo"

For example, in development, React throws away the cache when you edit the file of your component. Both in development and in production, React will throw away the cache if your component suspends during the initial mount. In the future, React may add more features that take advantage of throwing away the cache—for example, if React adds built-in support for virtualized lists in the future, it would make sense to throw away the cache for items that scroll out of the virtualized table viewport. This should be fine if you rely on useMemo solely as a performance optimization. Otherwise, a state variable or a ref may be more appropriate.\nNote\n\nCaching return values like this is also known as memoization, which is why this Hook is called useMemo.\n\nUsage \nSkipping expensive recalculations \n\nTo cache a calculation between re-renders, wrap it in a useMemo call at the top level of your component:\n\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nYou need to pass two things to useMemo:\n\nA calculation function that takes no arguments, like () =>, and returns what you wanted to calculate.\nA list of dependencies including every value within your component that’s used inside your calculation.\n\nOn the initial render, the value you’ll get from useMemo will be the result of calling your calculation.\n\nOn every subsequent render, React will compare the dependencies with the dependencies you passed during the last render. If none of the dependencies have changed (compared with Object.is), useMemo will return the value you already calculated before. Otherwise, React will re-run your calculation and return the new value.\n\nIn other words, useMemo caches a calculation result between re-renders until its dependencies change.\n\nLet’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.\n\nBy default, React will re-run the entire body of your component every time that it re-renders. For example, if this TodoList updates its state or receives new props from its parent, the filterTodos function will re-run:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nUsually, this isn’t a problem because most calculations are very fast. However, if you’re filtering or transforming a large array, or doing some expensive computation, you might want to skip doing it again if data hasn’t changed. If both todos and tab are the same as they were during the last render, wrapping the calculation in useMemo like earlier lets you reuse visibleTodos you’ve already calculated before.\n\nThis type of caching is called memoization.\n\nNote\n\nYou should only rely on useMemo as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add useMemo to improve performance.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow to tell if a calculation is expensive? \nShow Details\nDEEP DIVE\nShould you add useMemo everywhere? \nShow Details\nThe difference between useMemo and calculating a value directly\n1. Skipping recalculation with useMemo\n2. Always recalculating a value\nExample 1 of 2: Skipping recalculation with useMemo \n\nIn this example, the filterTodos implementation is artificially slowed down so that you can see what happens when some JavaScript function you’re calling during rendering is genuinely slow. Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme.\n\nSwitching the tabs feels slow because it forces the slowed down filterTodos to re-execute. That’s expected because the tab has changed, and so the entire calculation needs to re-run. (If you’re curious why it runs twice, it’s explained here.)\n\nToggle the theme. Thanks to useMemo, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! The slow filterTodos call was skipped because both todos and tab (which you pass as dependencies to useMemo) haven’t changed since the last render.\n\nApp.js\nTodoList.js\nutils.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';\nimport { filterTodos } from './utils.js'\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, theme, tab }) {\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(\n    () => filterTodos(todos, tab),\n    [todos, tab]\n  );\n  return (\n    <div className={theme}>\n      <p><b>Note: <code>filterTodos</code> is artificially slowed down!</b></p>\n      <ul>\n        {visibleTodos.map(todo => (\n          <li key={todo.id}>\n            {todo.completed ?\n              <s>{todo.text}</s> :\n              todo.text\n            }\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nSkipping re-rendering of components \n\nIn some cases, useMemo can also help you optimize performance of re-rendering child components. To illustrate this, let’s say this TodoList component passes the visibleTodos as a prop to the child List component:\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      <List items={visibleTodos} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nYou’ve noticed that toggling the theme prop freezes the app for a moment, but if you remove <List /> from your JSX, it feels fast. This tells you that it’s worth trying to optimize the List component.\n\nBy default, when a component re-renders, React re-renders all of its children recursively. This is why, when TodoList re-renders with a different theme, the List component also re-renders. This is fine for components that don’t require much calculation to re-render. But if you’ve verified that a re-render is slow, you can tell List to skip re-rendering when its props are the same as on last render by wrapping it in memo:\n\nimport { memo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst List = memo(function List({ items }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nWith this change, List will skip re-rendering if all of its props are the same as on the last render. This is where caching the calculation becomes important! Imagine that you calculated visibleTodos without useMemo:\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  // Every time the theme changes, this will be a different array...\n\n  const visibleTodos = filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      {/* ... so List's props will never be the same, and it will re-render every time */}\n\n      <List items={visibleTodos} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn the above example, the filterTodos function always creates a different array, similar to how the {} object literal always creates a new object. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it means that List props will never be the same, and your memo optimization won’t work. This is where useMemo comes in handy:\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {\n\n  // Tell React to cache your calculation between re-renders...\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(\n\n    () => filterTodos(todos, tab),\n\n    [todos, tab] // ...so as long as these dependencies don't change...\n\n  );\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className={theme}>\n\n      {/* ...List will receive the same props and can skip re-rendering */}\n\n      <List items={visibleTodos} />\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nBy wrapping the visibleTodos calculation in useMemo, you ensure that it has the same value between the re-renders (until dependencies change). You don’t have to wrap a calculation in useMemo unless you do it for some specific reason. In this example, the reason is that you pass it to a component wrapped in memo, and this lets it skip re-rendering. There are a few other reasons to add useMemo which are described further on this page.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nMemoizing individual JSX nodes \nShow Details\nThe difference between skipping re-renders and always re-rendering\n1.

Try switching the tabs and toggling the theme.\n\nSwitching the tabs feels slow because it forces the slowed down List to re-render. That’s expected because the tab has changed, and so you need to reflect the user’s new choice on the screen.\n\nNext, try toggling the theme. Thanks to useMemo together with memo, it’s fast despite the artificial slowdown! The List skipped re-rendering because the visibleTodos array has not changed since the last render. The visibleTodos array has not changed because both todos and tab (which you pass as dependencies to useMemo) haven’t changed since the last render.\n\nApp.js\nTodoList.js\nList.js\nutils.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useMemo } from 'react';\nimport List from './List.js';\nimport { filterTodos } from './utils.js'\n\nexport default function TodoList({ todos, theme, tab }) {\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(\n    () => filterTodos(todos, tab),\n    [todos, tab]\n  );\n  return (\n    <div className={theme}>\n      <p><b>Note: <code>List</code> is artificially slowed down!</b></p>\n      <List items={visibleTodos} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nPreventing an Effect from firing too often \n\nSometimes, you might want to use a value inside an Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  const options = {\n\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n    roomId: roomId\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    // ...\n\nThis creates a problem. Every reactive value must be declared as a dependency of your Effect. However, if you declare options as a dependency, it will cause your Effect to constantly reconnect to the chat room:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [options]); // 🔴 Problem: This dependency changes on every render\n\n  // ...\n\nTo solve this, you can wrap the object you need to call from an Effect in useMemo:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  const options = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return {\n\n      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    };\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [options]); // ✅ Only changes when options changes\n\n  // ...\n\nThis ensures that the options object is the same between re-renders if useMemo returns the cached object.\n\nHowever, since useMemo is performance optimization, not a semantic guarantee, React may throw away the cached value if there is a specific reason to do that. This will also cause the effect to re-fire, so it’s even better to remove the need for a function dependency by moving your object inside the Effect:\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const options = { // ✅ No need for useMemo or object dependencies!\n\n      serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234',\n\n      roomId: roomId\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    const connection = createConnection(options);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]); // ✅ Only changes when roomId changes\n\n  // ...\n\nNow your code is simpler and doesn’t need useMemo. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.\n\nMemoizing a dependency of another Hook \n\nSuppose you have a calculation that depends on an object created directly in the component body:\n\nfunction Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {\n\n  const searchOptions = { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };\n\n\n\n  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);\n\n  }, [allItems, searchOptions]); // 🚩 Caution: Dependency on an object created in the component body\n\n  // ...\n\nDepending on an object like this defeats the point of memoization. When a component re-renders, all of the code directly inside the component body runs again. The lines of code creating the searchOptions object will also run on every re-render. Since searchOptions is a dependency of your useMemo call, and it’s different every time, React knows the dependencies are different, and recalculate searchItems every time.\n\nTo fix this, you could memoize the searchOptions object itself before passing it as a dependency:\n\nfunction Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {\n\n  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };\n\n  }, [text]); // ✅ Only changes when text changes\n\n\n\n  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);\n\n  }, [allItems, searchOptions]); // ✅ Only changes when allItems or searchOptions changes\n\n  // ...\n\nIn the example above, if the text did not change, the searchOptions object also won’t change. However, an even better fix is to move the searchOptions object declaration inside of the useMemo calculation function:\n\nfunction Dropdown({ allItems, text }) {\n\n  const visibleItems = useMemo(() => {\n\n    const searchOptions = { matchMode: 'whole-word', text };\n\n    return searchItems(allItems, searchOptions);\n\n  }, [allItems, text]); // ✅ Only changes when allItems or text changes\n\n  // ...\n\nNow your calculation depends on text directly (which is a string and can’t “accidentally” become different).\n\nMemoizing a function \n\nSuppose the Form component is wrapped in memo. You want to pass a function to it as a prop:\n\nexport default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  function handleSubmit(orderDetails) {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;\n\n}\n\nJust as {} creates a different object, function declarations like function() {} and expressions like () => {} produce a different function on every re-render. By itself, creating a new function is not a problem. This is not something to avoid! However, if the Form component is memoized, presumably you want to skip re-rendering it when no props have changed. A prop that is always different would defeat the point of memoization.\n\nTo memoize a function with useMemo, your calculation function would have to return another function:\n\nexport default function Page({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return (orderDetails) => {\n\n      post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n        referrer,\n\n        orderDetails\n\n      });\n\n    };\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n\n\n  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;\n\n}\n\nThis looks clunky! Memoizing functions is common enough that React has a built-in Hook specifically for that. Wrap your functions into useCallback instead of useMemo to avoid having to write an extra nested function:\n\nexport default function Page({ productId, referrer }) {\n\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {\n\n    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {\n\n      referrer,\n\n      orderDetails\n\n    });\n\n  }, [productId, referrer]);\n\n\n\n  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} />;\n\n}\n\nThe two examples above are completely equivalent. The only benefit to useCallback is that it lets you avoid writing an extra nested function inside. It doesn’t do anything else. Read more about useCallback.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy calculation runs twice on every re-render \n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab }) {\n\n  // This component function will run twice for every render.\n\n\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {\n\n    // This calculation will run twice if any of the dependencies change.\n\n    return filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n  }, [todos, tab]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is expected and shouldn’t break your code.\n\nThis development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component and calculation functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice and fix the mistake.\n\nFor example, this impure calculation function mutates an array you received as a prop:\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {\n\n    // 🚩 Mistake: mutating a prop\n\n    todos.push({ id: 'last', text: 'Go for a walk!' });\n\n    const filtered = filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n    return filtered;\n\n  }, [todos, tab]);\n\nReact calls your function twice, so you’d notice the todo is added twice. Your calculation shouldn’t change any existing objects, but it’s okay to change any new objects you created during the calculation. For example, if the filterTodos function always returns a different array, you can mutate that array instead:\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {\n\n    const filtered = filterTodos(todos, tab);\n\n    // ✅ Correct: mutating an object you created during the calculation\n\n    filtered.push({ id: 'last', text: 'Go for a walk!' });\n\n    return filtered;\n\n  }, [todos, tab]);\n\nRead keeping components pure to learn more about purity.\n\nAlso, check out the guides on updating objects and updating arrays without mutation.\n\nMy useMemo call is supposed to return an object, but returns undefined \n\nThis code doesn’t work:\n\n  // 🔴 You can't return an object from an arrow function with () => {\n\n  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {\n\n    matchMode: 'whole-word',\n\n    text: text\n\n  }, [text]);\n\nIn JavaScript, () => { starts the arrow function body, so the { brace is not a part of your object. This is why it doesn’t return an object, and leads to mistakes. You could fix it by adding parentheses like ({ and }):\n\n  // This works, but is easy for someone to break again\n\n  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => ({\n\n    matchMode: 'whole-word',\n\n    text: text\n\n  }), [text]);\n\nHowever, this is still confusing and too easy for someone to break by removing the parentheses.\n\nTo avoid this mistake, write a return statement explicitly:\n\n  // ✅ This works and is explicit\n\n  const searchOptions = useMemo(() => {\n\n    return {\n\n      matchMode: 'whole-word',\n\n      text: text\n\n    };\n\n  }, [text]);\nEvery time my component renders, the calculation in useMemo re-runs \n\nMake sure you’ve specified the dependency array as a second argument!\n\nIf you forget the dependency array, useMemo will re-run the calculation every time:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab }) {\n\n  // 🔴 Recalculates every time: no dependency array\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab));\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is the corrected version passing the dependency array as a second argument:\n\nfunction TodoList({ todos, tab }) {\n\n  // ✅ Does not recalculate unnecessarily\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);\n\n  // ...\n\nIf this doesn’t help, then the problem is that at least one of your dependencies is different from the previous render. You can debug this problem by manually logging your dependencies to the console:\n\n  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);\n\n  console.log([todos, tab]);\n\nYou can then right-click on the arrays from different re-renders in the console and select “Store as a global variable” for both of them. Assuming the first one got saved as temp1 and the second one got saved as temp2, you can then use the browser console to check whether each dependency in both arrays is the same:\n\nObject.is(temp1[0], temp2[0]); // Is the first dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[1], temp2[1]); // Is the second dependency the same between the arrays?\n\nObject.is(temp1[2], temp2[2]); // ... and so on for every dependency ...\n\nWhen you find which dependency breaks memoization, either find a way to remove it, or memoize it as well.\n\nI need to call useMemo for each list item in a loop, but it’s not allowed \n\nSuppose the Chart component is wrapped in memo. You want to skip re-rendering every Chart in the list when the ReportList component re-renders. However, you can’t call useMemo in a loop:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <article>\n\n      {items.map(item => {\n\n        // 🔴 You can't call useMemo in a loop like this:\n\n        const data = useMemo(() => calculateReport(item), [item]);\n\n        return (\n\n          <figure key={item.id}>\n\n            <Chart data={data} />\n\n          </figure>\n\n        );\n\n      })}\n\n    </article>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nInstead, extract a component for each item and memoize data for individual items:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <article>\n\n      {items.map(item =>\n\n        <Report key={item.id} item={item} />\n\n      )}\n\n    </article>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Report({ item }) {\n\n  // ✅ Call useMemo at the top level:\n\n  const data = useMemo(() => calculateReport(item), [item]);\n\n  return (\n\n    <figure>\n\n      <Chart data={data} />\n\n    </figure>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, you could remove useMemo and instead wrap Report itself in memo. If the item prop does not change, Report will skip re-rendering, so Chart will skip re-rendering too:\n\nfunction ReportList({ items }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst Report = memo(function Report({ item }) {\n\n  const data = calculateReport(item);\n\n  return (\n\n    <figure>\n\n      <Chart data={data} />\n\n    </figure>\n\n  );\n\n});\nPREVIOUS\nuseLayoutEffect\nNEXT\nuseOptimistic"

It accepts some state as an argument and returns a copy of that state that can be different during the duration of an async action such as a network request. You provide a function that takes the current state and the input to the action, and returns the optimistic state to be used while the action is pending.\n\nThis state is called the “optimistic” state because it is usually used to immediately present the user with the result of performing an action, even though the action actually takes time to complete.\n\nimport { useOptimistic } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction AppContainer() {\n\n  const [optimisticState, addOptimistic] = useOptimistic(\n\n    state,\n\n    // updateFn\n\n    (currentState, optimisticValue) => {\n\n      // merge and return new state\n\n      // with optimistic value\n\n    }\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \nstate: the value to be returned initially and whenever no action is pending.\nupdateFn(currentState, optimisticValue): a function that takes the current state and the optimistic value passed to addOptimistic and returns the resulting optimistic state. It must be a pure function. updateFn takes in two parameters. The currentState and the optimisticValue. The return value will be the merged value of the currentState and optimisticValue.\nReturns \noptimisticState: The resulting optimistic state. It is equal to state unless an action is pending, in which case it is equal to the value returned by updateFn.\naddOptimistic: addOptimistic is the dispatching function to call when you have an optimistic update. It takes one argument, optimisticValue, of any type and will call the updateFn with state and optimisticValue.\nUsage \nOptimistically updating forms \n\nThe useOptimistic Hook provides a way to optimistically update the user interface before a background operation, like a network request, completes. In the context of forms, this technique helps to make apps feel more responsive. When a user submits a form, instead of waiting for the server’s response to reflect the changes, the interface is immediately updated with the expected outcome.\n\nFor example, when a user types a message into the form and hits the “Send” button, the useOptimistic Hook allows the message to immediately appear in the list with a “Sending…” label, even before the message is actually sent to a server. This “optimistic” approach gives the impression of speed and responsiveness. The form then attempts to truly send the message in the background. Once the server confirms the message has been received, the “Sending…” label is removed.\n\nApp.js\nactions.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useOptimistic, useState, useRef, startTransition } from \"react\";\nimport { deliverMessage } from \"./actions.js\";\n\nfunction Thread({ messages, sendMessageAction }) {\n  const formRef = useRef();\n  function formAction(formData) {\n    addOptimisticMessage(formData.get(\"message\"));\n    formRef.current.reset();\n    startTransition(async () => {\n      await sendMessageAction(formData);\n    });\n  }\n  const [optimisticMessages, addOptimisticMessage] = useOptimistic(\n    messages,\n    (state, newMessage) => [\n      {\n        text: newMessage,\n        sending: true\n      },\n      ...state,\n    ]\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <form action={formAction} ref={formRef}>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"message\" placeholder=\"Hello!\" />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n      {optimisticMessages.map((message, index) => (\n        <div key={index}>\n          {message.text}\n          {!!message.sending && <small> (Sending...)</small>}\n        </div>\n      ))}\n      \n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([\n    { text: \"Hello there!\", sending: false, key: 1 }\n  ]);\n  async function sendMessageAction(formData) {\n    const sentMessage = await deliverMessage(formData.get(\"message\"));\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setMessages((messages) => [{ text: sentMessage }, ...messages]);\n    })\n  }\n  return <Thread messages={messages} sendMessageAction={sendMessageAction} />;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPREVIOUS\nuseMemo\nNEXT\nuseReducer"

It must be pure, should take the state and action as arguments, and should return the next state. State and action can be of any types.\ninitialArg: The value from which the initial state is calculated. It can be a value of any type. How the initial state is calculated from it depends on the next init argument.\noptional init: The initializer function that should return the initial state. If it’s not specified, the initial state is set to initialArg. Otherwise, the initial state is set to the result of calling init(initialArg).\nReturns \n\nuseReducer returns an array with exactly two values:\n\nThe current state. During the first render, it’s set to init(initialArg) or initialArg (if there’s no init).\nThe dispatch function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.\nCaveats \nuseReducer is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.\nThe dispatch function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your reducer and initializer twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your reducer and initializer are pure (as they should be), this should not affect your logic. The result from one of the calls is ignored.\ndispatch function \n\nThe dispatch function returned by useReducer lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You need to pass the action as the only argument to the dispatch function:\n\nconst [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });\n\n\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });\n\n  // ...\n\nReact will set the next state to the result of calling the reducer function you’ve provided with the current state and the action you’ve passed to dispatch.\n\nParameters \naction: The action performed by the user. It can be a value of any type. By convention, an action is usually an object with a type property identifying it and, optionally, other properties with additional information.\nReturns \n\ndispatch functions do not have a return value.\n\nCaveats \n\nThe dispatch function only updates the state variable for the next render. If you read the state variable after calling the dispatch function, you will still get the old value that was on the screen before your call.\n\nIf the new value you provide is identical to the current state, as determined by an Object.is comparison, React will skip re-rendering the component and its children. This is an optimization. React may still need to call your component before ignoring the result, but it shouldn’t affect your code.\n\nReact batches state updates. It updates the screen after all the event handlers have run and have called their set functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use flushSync.\n\nUsage \nAdding a reducer to a component \n\nCall useReducer at the top level of your component to manage state with a reducer.\n\nimport { useReducer } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });\n\n  // ...\n\nuseReducer returns an array with exactly two items:\n\nThe current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.\nThe dispatch function that lets you change it in response to interaction.\n\nTo update what’s on the screen, call dispatch with an object representing what the user did, called an action:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });\n\n}\n\nReact will pass the current state and the action to your reducer function. Your reducer will calculate and return the next state. React will store that next state, render your component with it, and update the UI.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useReducer } from 'react';\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n  if (action.type === 'incremented_age') {\n    return {\n      age: state.age + 1\n    };\n  }\n  throw Error('Unknown action.');\n}\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' })\n      }}>\n        Increment age\n      </button>\n      <p>Hello! You are {state.age}.</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nuseReducer is very similar to useState, but it lets you move the state update logic from event handlers into a single function outside of your component. Read more about choosing between useState and useReducer.\n\nWriting the reducer function \n\nA reducer function is declared like this:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThen you need to fill in the code that will calculate and return the next state. By convention, it is common to write it as a switch statement. For each case in the switch, calculate and return some next state.\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      return {\n\n        name: state.name,\n\n        age: state.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    case 'changed_name': {\n\n      return {\n\n        name: action.nextName,\n\n        age: state.age\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);\n\n}\n\nActions can have any shape. By convention, it’s common to pass objects with a type property identifying the action. It should include the minimal necessary information that the reducer needs to compute the next state.\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { name: 'Taylor', age: 42 });\n\n  \n\n  function handleButtonClick() {\n\n    dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' });\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  function handleInputChange(e) {\n\n    dispatch({\n\n      type: 'changed_name',\n\n      nextName: e.target.value\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nThe action type names are local to your component. Each action describes a single interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in data. The shape of the state is arbitrary, but usually it’ll be an object or an array.\n\nRead extracting state logic into a reducer to learn more.\n\nPitfall\n\nState is read-only. Don’t modify any objects or arrays in state:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      // 🚩 Don't mutate an object in state like this:\n\n      state.age = state.age + 1;\n\n      return state;\n\n    }\n\nInstead, always return new objects from your reducer:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      // ✅ Instead, return a new object\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state,\n\n        age: state.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\nRead updating objects in state and updating arrays in state to learn more.\n\nBasic useReducer examples\n1.

You are {state.age}.</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nAvoiding recreating the initial state \n\nReact saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.\n\nfunction createInitialState(username) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction TodoList({ username }) {\n\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, createInitialState(username));\n\n  // ...\n\nAlthough the result of createInitialState(username) is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.\n\nTo solve this, you may pass it as an initializer function to useReducer as the third argument instead:\n\nfunction createInitialState(username) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction TodoList({ username }) {\n\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, username, createInitialState);\n\n  // ...\n\nNotice that you’re passing createInitialState, which is the function itself, and not createInitialState(), which is the result of calling it. This way, the initial state does not get re-created after initialization.\n\nIn the above example, createInitialState takes a username argument. If your initializer doesn’t need any information to compute the initial state, you may pass null as the second argument to useReducer.\n\nThe difference between passing an initializer and passing the initial state directly\n1. Passing the initializer function\n2. Passing the initial state directly\nExample 1 of 2: Passing the initializer function \n\nThis example passes the initializer function, so the createInitialState function only runs during initialization. It does not run when component re-renders, such as when you type into the input.\n\nTodoList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useReducer } from 'react';\n\nfunction createInitialState(username) {\n  const initialTodos = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {\n    initialTodos.push({\n      id: i,\n      text: username + \"'s task #\" + (i + 1)\n    });\n  }\n  return {\n    draft: '',\n    todos: initialTodos,\n  };\n}\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'changed_draft': {\n      return {\n        draft: action.nextDraft,\n        todos: state.todos,\n      };\n    };\n    case 'added_todo': {\n      return {\n        draft: '',\n        todos: [{\n          id: state.todos.length,\n          text: state.draft\n        }, ...state.todos]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);\n}\n\nexport default function TodoList({ username }) {\n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(\n    reducer,\n    username,\n    createInitialState\n  );\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input\n        value={state.draft}\n        onChange={e => {\n          dispatch({\n            type: 'changed_draft',\n            nextDraft: e.target.value\n          })\n        }}\n      />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        dispatch({ type: 'added_todo' });\n      }}>Add</button>\n      <ul>\n        {state.todos.map(item => (\n          <li key={item.id}>\n            {item.text}\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nTroubleshooting \nI’ve dispatched an action, but logging gives me the old state value \n\nCalling the dispatch function does not change state in the running code:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  console.log(state.age);  // 42\n\n\n\n  dispatch({ type: 'incremented_age' }); // Request a re-render with 43\n\n  console.log(state.age);  // Still 42!\n\n\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    console.log(state.age); // Also 42!\n\n  }, 5000);\n\n}\n\nThis is because states behaves like a snapshot. Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the state JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.\n\nIf you need to guess the next state value, you can calculate it manually by calling the reducer yourself:\n\nconst action = { type: 'incremented_age' };\n\ndispatch(action);\n\n\n\nconst nextState = reducer(state, action);\n\nconsole.log(state);     // { age: 42 }\n\nconsole.log(nextState); // { age: 43 }\nI’ve dispatched an action, but the screen doesn’t update \n\nReact will ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state, as determined by an Object.is comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object\n\n      state.age++;\n\n      return state;\n\n    }\n\n    case 'changed_name': {\n\n      // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object\n\n      state.name = action.nextName;\n\n      return state;\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nYou mutated an existing state object and returned it, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you’re always updating objects in state and updating arrays in state instead of mutating them:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      // ✅ Correct: creating a new object\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state,\n\n        age: state.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    case 'changed_name': {\n\n      // ✅ Correct: creating a new object\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state,\n\n        name: action.nextName\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n}\nA part of my reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching \n\nMake sure that every case branch copies all of the existing fields when returning the new state:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state, // Don't forget this!\n\n        age: state.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\nWithout ...state above, the returned next state would only contain the age field and nothing else.\n\nMy entire reducer state becomes undefined after dispatching \n\nIf your state unexpectedly becomes undefined, you’re likely forgetting to return state in one of the cases, or your action type doesn’t match any of the case statements. To find why, throw an error outside the switch:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'incremented_age': {\n\n      // ...\n\n    }\n\n    case 'edited_name': {\n\n      // ...\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n  throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);\n\n}\n\nYou can also use a static type checker like TypeScript to catch such mistakes.\n\nI’m getting an error: “Too many re-renders” \n\nYou might get an error that says: Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop. Typically, this means that you’re unconditionally dispatching an action during render, so your component enters a loop: render, dispatch (which causes a render), render, dispatch (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: calls the handler during render\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: passes down the event handler\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: passes down an inline function\n\nreturn <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>\n\nIf you can’t find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific dispatch function call responsible for the error.\n\nMy reducer or initializer function runs twice \n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your reducer and initializer functions twice. This shouldn’t break your code.\n\nThis development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and reducer functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.\n\nFor example, this impure reducer function mutates an array in state:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'added_todo': {\n\n      // 🚩 Mistake: mutating state\n\n      state.todos.push({ id: nextId++, text: action.text });\n\n      return state;\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nBecause React calls your reducer function twice, you’ll see the todo was added twice, so you’ll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by replacing the array instead of mutating it:\n\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\n\n  switch (action.type) {\n\n    case 'added_todo': {\n\n      // ✅ Correct: replacing with new state\n\n      return {\n\n        ...state,\n\n        todos: [\n\n          ...state.todos,\n\n          { id: nextId++, text: action.text }\n\n        ]\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nNow that this reducer function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn’t make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. Only component, initializer, and reducer functions need to be pure. Event handlers don’t need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.\n\nRead keeping components pure to learn more.\n\nPREVIOUS\nuseOptimistic\nNEXT\nuseRef"

It can be a value of any type. This argument is ignored after the initial render.\nReturns \n\nuseRef returns an object with a single property:\n\ncurrent: Initially, it’s set to the initialValue you have passed. You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a ref attribute to a JSX node, React will set its current property.\n\nOn the next renders, useRef will return the same object.\n\nCaveats \nYou can mutate the ref.current property. Unlike state, it is mutable. However, if it holds an object that is used for rendering (for example, a piece of your state), then you shouldn’t mutate that object.\nWhen you change the ref.current property, React does not re-render your component. React is not aware of when you change it because a ref is a plain JavaScript object.\nDo not write or read ref.current during rendering, except for initialization. This makes your component’s behavior unpredictable.\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your component function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. Each ref object will be created twice, but one of the versions will be discarded. If your component function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior.\nUsage \nReferencing a value with a ref \n\nCall useRef at the top level of your component to declare one or more refs.\n\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Stopwatch() {\n\n  const intervalRef = useRef(0);\n\n  // ...\n\nuseRef returns a ref object with a single current property initially set to the initial value you provided.\n\nOn the next renders, useRef will return the same object. You can change its current property to store information and read it later. This might remind you of state, but there is an important difference.\n\nChanging a ref does not trigger a re-render. This means refs are perfect for storing information that doesn’t affect the visual output of your component. For example, if you need to store an interval ID and retrieve it later, you can put it in a ref. To update the value inside the ref, you need to manually change its current property:\n\nfunction handleStartClick() {\n\n  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }, 1000);\n\n  intervalRef.current = intervalId;\n\n}\n\nLater, you can read that interval ID from the ref so that you can call clear that interval:\n\nfunction handleStopClick() {\n\n  const intervalId = intervalRef.current;\n\n  clearInterval(intervalId);\n\n}\n\nBy using a ref, you ensure that:\n\nYou can store information between re-renders (unlike regular variables, which reset on every render).\nChanging it does not trigger a re-render (unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render).\nThe information is local to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).\n\nChanging a ref does not trigger a re-render, so refs are not appropriate for storing information you want to display on the screen. Use state for that instead. Read more about choosing between useRef and useState.\n\nExamples of referencing a value with useRef\n1. Click counter\n2. A stopwatch\nExample 1 of 2: Click counter \n\nThis component uses a ref to keep track of how many times the button was clicked. Note that it’s okay to use a ref instead of state here because the click count is only read and written in an event handler.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  let ref = useRef(0);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current = ref.current + 1;\n    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n      Click me!\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIf you show {ref.current} in the JSX, the number won’t update on click. This is because setting ref.current does not trigger a re-render. Information that’s used for rendering should be state instead.\n\nNext Example\nPitfall\n\nDo not write or read ref.current during rendering.\n\nReact expects that the body of your component behaves like a pure function:\n\nIf the inputs (props, state, and context) are the same, it should return exactly the same JSX.\nCalling it in a different order or with different arguments should not affect the results of other calls.\n\nReading or writing a ref during rendering breaks these expectations.\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  // 🚩 Don't write a ref during rendering\n\n  myRef.current = 123;\n\n  // ...\n\n  // 🚩 Don't read a ref during rendering\n\n  return <h1>{myOtherRef.current}</h1>;\n\n}\n\nYou can read or write refs from event handlers or effects instead.\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    // ✅ You can read or write refs in effects\n\n    myRef.current = 123;\n\n  });\n\n  // ...\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    // ✅ You can read or write refs in event handlers\n\n    doSomething(myOtherRef.current);\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIf you have to read or write something during rendering, use state instead.\n\nWhen you break these rules, your component might still work, but most of the newer features we’re adding to React will rely on these expectations. Read more about keeping your components pure.\n\nManipulating the DOM with a ref \n\nIt’s particularly common to use a ref to manipulate the DOM. React has built-in support for this.\n\nFirst, declare a ref object with an initial value of null:\n\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  // ...\n\nThen pass your ref object as the ref attribute to the JSX of the DOM node you want to manipulate:\n\n  // ...\n\n  return <input ref={inputRef} />;\n\nAfter React creates the DOM node and puts it on the screen, React will set the current property of your ref object to that DOM node. Now you can access the <input>’s DOM node and call methods like focus():\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    inputRef.current.focus();\n\n  }\n\nReact will set the current property back to null when the node is removed from the screen.\n\nRead more about manipulating the DOM with refs.\n\nExamples of manipulating the DOM with useRef\n1.

It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions. This argument is ignored after the initial render.\nIf you pass a function as initialState, it will be treated as an initializer function. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value of any type. React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, and store its return value as the initial state. See an example below.\nReturns \n\nuseState returns an array with exactly two values:\n\nThe current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed.\nThe set function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.\nCaveats \nuseState is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your initializer function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your initializer function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.\nset functions, like setSomething(nextState) \n\nThe set function returned by useState lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You can pass the next state directly, or a function that calculates it from the previous state:\n\nconst [name, setName] = useState('Edward');\n\n\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setName('Taylor');\n\n  setAge(a => a + 1);\n\n  // ...\nParameters \nnextState: The value that you want the state to be. It can be a value of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions.\nIf you pass a function as nextState, it will be treated as an updater function. It must be pure, should take the pending state as its only argument, and should return the next state. React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state. See an example below.\nReturns \n\nset functions do not have a return value.\n\nCaveats \n\nThe set function only updates the state variable for the next render. If you read the state variable after calling the set function, you will still get the old value that was on the screen before your call.\n\nIf the new value you provide is identical to the current state, as determined by an Object.is comparison, React will skip re-rendering the component and its children. This is an optimization. Although in some cases React may still need to call your component before skipping the children, it shouldn’t affect your code.\n\nReact batches state updates. It updates the screen after all the event handlers have run and have called their set functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use flushSync.\n\nThe set function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.\n\nCalling the set function during rendering is only allowed from within the currently rendering component. React will discard its output and immediately attempt to render it again with the new state. This pattern is rarely needed, but you can use it to store information from the previous renders. See an example below.\n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your updater function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your updater function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.\n\nUsage \nAdding state to a component \n\nCall useState at the top level of your component to declare one or more state variables.\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\n  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  // ...\n\nThe convention is to name state variables like [something, setSomething] using array destructuring.\n\nuseState returns an array with exactly two items:\n\nThe current state of this state variable, initially set to the initial state you provided.\nThe set function that lets you change it to any other value in response to interaction.\n\nTo update what’s on the screen, call the set function with some next state:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setName('Robin');\n\n}\n\nReact will store the next state, render your component again with the new values, and update the UI.\n\nPitfall\n\nCalling the set function does not change the current state in the already executing code:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setName('Robin');\n\n  console.log(name); // Still \"Taylor\"!\n\n}\n\nIt only affects what useState will return starting from the next render.\n\nBasic useState examples\n1. Counter (number)\n2. Text field (string)\n3. Checkbox (boolean)\n4. Form (two variables)\nExample 1 of 4: Counter (number) \n\nIn this example, the count state variable holds a number. Clicking the button increments it.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n      You pressed me {count} times\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nNext Example\nUpdating state based on the previous state \n\nSuppose the age is 42. This handler calls setAge(age + 1) three times:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)\n\n  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)\n\n  setAge(age + 1); // setAge(42 + 1)\n\n}\n\nHowever, after one click, age will only be 43 rather than 45! This is because calling the set function does not update the age state variable in the already running code. So each setAge(age + 1) call becomes setAge(43).\n\nTo solve this problem, you may pass an updater function to setAge instead of the next state:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(42 => 43)\n\n  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(43 => 44)\n\n  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(44 => 45)\n\n}\n\nHere, a => a + 1 is your updater function. It takes the pending state and calculates the next state from it.\n\nReact puts your updater functions in a queue. Then, during the next render, it will call them in the same order:\n\na => a + 1 will receive 42 as the pending state and return 43 as the next state.\na => a + 1 will receive 43 as the pending state and return 44 as the next state.\na => a + 1 will receive 44 as the pending state and return 45 as the next state.\n\nThere are no other queued updates, so React will store 45 as the current state in the end.\n\nBy convention, it’s common to name the pending state argument for the first letter of the state variable name, like a for age. However, you may also call it like prevAge or something else that you find clearer.\n\nReact may call your updaters twice in development to verify that they are pure.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nIs using an updater always preferred? \nShow Details\nThe difference between passing an updater and passing the next state directly\n1. Passing the updater function\n2. Passing the next state directly\nExample 1 of 2: Passing the updater function \n\nThis example passes the updater function, so the “+3” button works.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\n  function increment() {\n    setAge(a => a + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Your age: {age}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        increment();\n        increment();\n        increment();\n      }}>+3</button>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        increment();\n      }}>+1</button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nUpdating objects and arrays in state \n\nYou can put objects and arrays into state. In React, state is considered read-only, so you should replace it rather than mutate your existing objects. For example, if you have a form object in state, don’t mutate it:\n\n// 🚩 Don't mutate an object in state like this:\n\nform.firstName = 'Taylor';\n\nInstead, replace the whole object by creating a new one:\n\n// ✅ Replace state with a new object\n\nsetForm({\n\n  ...form,\n\n  firstName: 'Taylor'\n\n});\n\nRead updating objects in state and updating arrays in state to learn more.\n\nExamples of objects and arrays in state\n1. Form (object)\n2. Form (nested object)\n3. List (array)\n4. Writing concise update logic with Immer\nExample 1 of 4: Form (object) \n\nIn this example, the form state variable holds an object. Each input has a change handler that calls setForm with the next state of the entire form. The { ...form } spread syntax ensures that the state object is replaced rather than mutated.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [form, setForm] = useState({\n    firstName: 'Barbara',\n    lastName: 'Hepworth',\n    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com',\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        First name:\n        <input\n          value={form.firstName}\n          onChange={e => {\n            setForm({\n              ...form,\n              firstName: e.target.value\n            });\n          }}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Last name:\n        <input\n          value={form.lastName}\n          onChange={e => {\n            setForm({\n              ...form,\n              lastName: e.target.value\n            });\n          }}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Email:\n        <input\n          value={form.email}\n          onChange={e => {\n            setForm({\n              ...form,\n              email: e.target.value\n            });\n          }}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <p>\n        {form.firstName}{' '}\n        {form.lastName}{' '}\n        ({form.email})\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nAvoiding recreating the initial state \n\nReact saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos());\n\n  // ...\n\nAlthough the result of createInitialTodos() is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.\n\nTo solve this, you may pass it as an initializer function to useState instead:\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos);\n\n  // ...\n\nNotice that you’re passing createInitialTodos, which is the function itself, and not createInitialTodos(), which is the result of calling it. If you pass a function to useState, React will only call it during initialization.\n\nReact may call your initializers twice in development to verify that they are pure.\n\nThe difference between passing an initializer and passing the initial state directly\n1. Passing the initializer function\n2. Passing the initial state directly\nExample 1 of 2: Passing the initializer function \n\nThis example passes the initializer function, so the createInitialTodos function only runs during initialization. It does not run when component re-renders, such as when you type into the input.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction createInitialTodos() {\n  const initialTodos = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {\n    initialTodos.push({\n      id: i,\n      text: 'Item ' + (i + 1)\n    });\n  }\n  return initialTodos;\n}\n\nexport default function TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos);\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input\n        value={text}\n        onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setText('');\n        setTodos([{\n          id: todos.length,\n          text: text\n        }, ...todos]);\n      }}>Add</button>\n      <ul>\n        {todos.map(item => (\n          <li key={item.id}>\n            {item.text}\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nResetting state with a key \n\nYou’ll often encounter the key attribute when rendering lists. However, it also serves another purpose.\n\nYou can reset a component’s state by passing a different key to a component. In this example, the Reset button changes the version state variable, which we pass as a key to the Form. When the key changes, React re-creates the Form component (and all of its children) from scratch, so its state gets reset.\n\nRead preserving and resetting state to learn more.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [version, setVersion] = useState(0);\n\n  function handleReset() {\n    setVersion(version + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset</button>\n      <Form key={version} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input\n        value={name}\n        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <p>Hello, {name}.</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nStoring information from previous renders \n\nUsually, you will update state in event handlers. However, in rare cases you might want to adjust state in response to rendering — for example, you might want to change a state variable when a prop changes.\n\nIn most cases, you don’t need this:\n\nIf the value you need can be computed entirely from the current props or other state, remove that redundant state altogether. If you’re worried about recomputing too often, the useMemo Hook can help.\nIf you want to reset the entire component tree’s state, pass a different key to your component.\nIf you can, update all the relevant state in the event handlers.\n\nIn the rare case that none of these apply, there is a pattern you can use to update state based on the values that have been rendered so far, by calling a set function while your component is rendering.\n\nHere’s an example. This CountLabel component displays the count prop passed to it:\n\nexport default function CountLabel({ count }) {\n\n  return <h1>{count}</h1>\n\n}\n\nSay you want to show whether the counter has increased or decreased since the last change. The count prop doesn’t tell you this — you need to keep track of its previous value. Add the prevCount state variable to track it. Add another state variable called trend to hold whether the count has increased or decreased. Compare prevCount with count, and if they’re not equal, update both prevCount and trend. Now you can show both the current count prop and how it has changed since the last render.\n\nApp.js\nCountLabel.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function CountLabel({ count }) {\n  const [prevCount, setPrevCount] = useState(count);\n  const [trend, setTrend] = useState(null);\n  if (prevCount !== count) {\n    setPrevCount(count);\n    setTrend(count > prevCount ? 'increasing' : 'decreasing');\n  }\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{count}</h1>\n      {trend && <p>The count is {trend}</p>}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNote that if you call a set function while rendering, it must be inside a condition like prevCount !== count, and there must be a call like setPrevCount(count) inside of the condition. Otherwise, your component would re-render in a loop until it crashes. Also, you can only update the state of the currently rendering component like this. Calling the set function of another component during rendering is an error. Finally, your set call should still update state without mutation — this doesn’t mean you can break other rules of pure functions.\n\nThis pattern can be hard to understand and is usually best avoided. However, it’s better than updating state in an effect. When you call the set function during render, React will re-render that component immediately after your component exits with a return statement, and before rendering the children. This way, children don’t need to render twice. The rest of your component function will still execute (and the result will be thrown away). If your condition is below all the Hook calls, you may add an early return; to restart rendering earlier.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI’ve updated the state, but logging gives me the old value \n\nCalling the set function does not change state in the running code:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  console.log(count);  // 0\n\n\n\n  setCount(count + 1); // Request a re-render with 1\n\n  console.log(count);  // Still 0!\n\n\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    console.log(count); // Also 0!\n\n  }, 5000);\n\n}\n\nThis is because states behaves like a snapshot. Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the count JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.\n\nIf you need to use the next state, you can save it in a variable before passing it to the set function:\n\nconst nextCount = count + 1;\n\nsetCount(nextCount);\n\n\n\nconsole.log(count);     // 0\n\nconsole.log(nextCount); // 1\nI’ve updated the state, but the screen doesn’t update \n\nReact will ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state, as determined by an Object.is comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:\n\nobj.x = 10;  // 🚩 Wrong: mutating existing object\n\nsetObj(obj); // 🚩 Doesn't do anything\n\nYou mutated an existing obj object and passed it back to setObj, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you’re always replacing objects and arrays in state instead of mutating them:\n\n// ✅ Correct: creating a new object\n\nsetObj({\n\n  ...obj,\n\n  x: 10\n\n});\nI’m getting an error: “Too many re-renders” \n\nYou might get an error that says: Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop. Typically, this means that you’re unconditionally setting state during render, so your component enters a loop: render, set state (which causes a render), render, set state (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: calls the handler during render\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick()}>Click me</button>\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: passes down the event handler\n\nreturn <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>\n\n\n\n// ✅ Correct: passes down an inline function\n\nreturn <button onClick={(e) => handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>\n\nIf you can’t find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific set function call responsible for the error.\n\nMy initializer or updater function runs twice \n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:\n\nfunction TodoList() {\n\n  // This component function will run twice for every render.\n\n\n\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => {\n\n    // This initializer function will run twice during initialization.\n\n    return createTodos();\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    setTodos(prevTodos => {\n\n      // This updater function will run twice for every click.\n\n      return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is expected and shouldn’t break your code.\n\nThis development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and updater functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.\n\nFor example, this impure updater function mutates an array in state:\n\nsetTodos(prevTodos => {\n\n  // 🚩 Mistake: mutating state\n\n  prevTodos.push(createTodo());\n\n});\n\nBecause React calls your updater function twice, you’ll see the todo was added twice, so you’ll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by replacing the array instead of mutating it:\n\nsetTodos(prevTodos => {\n\n  // ✅ Correct: replacing with new state\n\n  return [...prevTodos, createTodo()];\n\n});\n\nNow that this updater function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn’t make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. Only component, initializer, and updater functions need to be pure. Event handlers don’t need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.\n\nRead keeping components pure to learn more.\n\nI’m trying to set state to a function, but it gets called instead \n\nYou can’t put a function into state like this:\n\nconst [fn, setFn] = useState(someFunction);\n\n\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setFn(someOtherFunction);\n\n}\n\nBecause you’re passing a function, React assumes that someFunction is an initializer function, and that someOtherFunction is an updater function, so it tries to call them and store the result. To actually store a function, you have to put () => before them in both cases. Then React will store the functions you pass.\n\nconst [fn, setFn] = useState(() => someFunction);\n\n\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  setFn(() => someOtherFunction);\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\nuseRef\nNEXT\nuseSyncExternalStore"

You need to pass two functions as arguments:\n\nThe subscribe function should subscribe to the store and return a function that unsubscribes.\nThe getSnapshot function should read a snapshot of the data from the store.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nsubscribe: A function that takes a single callback argument and subscribes it to the store. When the store changes, it should invoke the provided callback, which will cause React to re-call getSnapshot and (if needed) re-render the component. The subscribe function should return a function that cleans up the subscription.\n\ngetSnapshot: A function that returns a snapshot of the data in the store that’s needed by the component. While the store has not changed, repeated calls to getSnapshot must return the same value. If the store changes and the returned value is different (as compared by Object.is), React re-renders the component.\n\noptional getServerSnapshot: A function that returns the initial snapshot of the data in the store. It will be used only during server rendering and during hydration of server-rendered content on the client. The server snapshot must be the same between the client and the server, and is usually serialized and passed from the server to the client. If you omit this argument, rendering the component on the server will throw an error.\n\nReturns \n\nThe current snapshot of the store which you can use in your rendering logic.\n\nCaveats \n\nThe store snapshot returned by getSnapshot must be immutable. If the underlying store has mutable data, return a new immutable snapshot if the data has changed. Otherwise, return a cached last snapshot.\n\nIf a different subscribe function is passed during a re-render, React will re-subscribe to the store using the newly passed subscribe function. You can prevent this by declaring subscribe outside the component.\n\nIf the store is mutated during a non-blocking Transition update, React will fall back to performing that update as blocking. Specifically, for every Transition update, React will call getSnapshot a second time just before applying changes to the DOM. If it returns a different value than when it was called originally, React will restart the update from scratch, this time applying it as a blocking update, to ensure that every component on screen is reflecting the same version of the store.\n\nIt’s not recommended to suspend a render based on a store value returned by useSyncExternalStore. The reason is that mutations to the external store cannot be marked as non-blocking Transition updates, so they will trigger the nearest Suspense fallback, replacing already-rendered content on screen with a loading spinner, which typically makes a poor UX.\n\nFor example, the following are discouraged:\n\nconst LazyProductDetailPage = lazy(() => import('./ProductDetailPage.js'));\n\n\n\nfunction ShoppingApp() {\n\n  const selectedProductId = useSyncExternalStore(...);\n\n\n\n  // ❌ Calling `use` with a Promise dependent on `selectedProductId`\n\n  const data = use(fetchItem(selectedProductId))\n\n\n\n  // ❌ Conditionally rendering a lazy component based on `selectedProductId`\n\n  return selectedProductId != null ? <LazyProductDetailPage /> : <FeaturedProducts />;\n\n}\nUsage \nSubscribing to an external store \n\nMost of your React components will only read data from their props, state, and context. However, sometimes a component needs to read some data from some store outside of React that changes over time. This includes:\n\nThird-party state management libraries that hold state outside of React.\nBrowser APIs that expose a mutable value and events to subscribe to its changes.\n\nCall useSyncExternalStore at the top level of your component to read a value from an external data store.\n\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\nimport { todosStore } from './todoStore.js';\n\n\n\nfunction TodosApp() {\n\n  const todos = useSyncExternalStore(todosStore.subscribe, todosStore.getSnapshot);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIt returns the snapshot of the data in the store. You need to pass two functions as arguments:\n\nThe subscribe function should subscribe to the store and return a function that unsubscribes.\nThe getSnapshot function should read a snapshot of the data from the store.\n\nReact will use these functions to keep your component subscribed to the store and re-render it on changes.\n\nFor example, in the sandbox below, todosStore is implemented as an external store that stores data outside of React. The TodosApp component connects to that external store with the useSyncExternalStore Hook.\n\nApp.js\ntodoStore.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\nimport { todosStore } from './todoStore.js';\n\nexport default function TodosApp() {\n  const todos = useSyncExternalStore(todosStore.subscribe, todosStore.getSnapshot);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => todosStore.addTodo()}>Add todo</button>\n      <hr />\n      <ul>\n        {todos.map(todo => (\n          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nWhen possible, we recommend using built-in React state with useState and useReducer instead. The useSyncExternalStore API is mostly useful if you need to integrate with existing non-React code.\n\nSubscribing to a browser API \n\nAnother reason to add useSyncExternalStore is when you want to subscribe to some value exposed by the browser that changes over time. For example, suppose that you want your component to display whether the network connection is active. The browser exposes this information via a property called navigator.onLine.\n\nThis value can change without React’s knowledge, so you should read it with useSyncExternalStore.\n\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatIndicator() {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nTo implement the getSnapshot function, read the current value from the browser API:\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  return navigator.onLine;\n\n}\n\nNext, you need to implement the subscribe function. For example, when navigator.onLine changes, the browser fires the online and offline events on the window object. You need to subscribe the callback argument to the corresponding events, and then return a function that cleans up the subscriptions:\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n\n  return () => {\n\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n\n  };\n\n}\n\nNow React knows how to read the value from the external navigator.onLine API and how to subscribe to its changes. Disconnect your device from the network and notice that the component re-renders in response:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\nexport default function ChatIndicator() {\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n  return navigator.onLine;\n}\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n  return () => {\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n  };\n}\n\n\nShow more\nExtracting the logic to a custom Hook \n\nUsually you won’t write useSyncExternalStore directly in your components. Instead, you’ll typically call it from your own custom Hook. This lets you use the same external store from different components.\n\nFor example, this custom useOnlineStatus Hook tracks whether the network is online:\n\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport function useOnlineStatus() {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n  return isOnline;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNow different components can call useOnlineStatus without repeating the underlying implementation:\n\nApp.js\nuseOnlineStatus.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useOnlineStatus } from './useOnlineStatus.js';\n\nfunction StatusBar() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction SaveButton() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  function handleSaveClick() {\n    console.log('✅ Progress saved');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>\n      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <SaveButton />\n      <StatusBar />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nAdding support for server rendering \n\nIf your React app uses server rendering, your React components will also run outside the browser environment to generate the initial HTML. This creates a few challenges when connecting to an external store:\n\nIf you’re connecting to a browser-only API, it won’t work because it does not exist on the server.\nIf you’re connecting to a third-party data store, you’ll need its data to match between the server and client.\n\nTo solve these issues, pass a getServerSnapshot function as the third argument to useSyncExternalStore:\n\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport function useOnlineStatus() {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot);\n\n  return isOnline;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  return navigator.onLine;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction getServerSnapshot() {\n\n  return true; // Always show \"Online\" for server-generated HTML\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThe getServerSnapshot function is similar to getSnapshot, but it runs only in two situations:\n\nIt runs on the server when generating the HTML.\nIt runs on the client during hydration, i.e. when React takes the server HTML and makes it interactive.\n\nThis lets you provide the initial snapshot value which will be used before the app becomes interactive. If there is no meaningful initial value for the server rendering, omit this argument to force rendering on the client.\n\nNote\n\nMake sure that getServerSnapshot returns the same exact data on the initial client render as it returned on the server. For example, if getServerSnapshot returned some prepopulated store content on the server, you need to transfer this content to the client. One way to do this is to emit a <script> tag during server rendering that sets a global like window.MY_STORE_DATA, and read from that global on the client in getServerSnapshot. Your external store should provide instructions on how to do that.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI’m getting an error: “The result of getSnapshot should be cached” \n\nThis error means your getSnapshot function returns a new object every time it’s called, for example:\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  // 🔴 Do not return always different objects from getSnapshot\n\n  return {\n\n    todos: myStore.todos\n\n  };\n\n}\n\nReact will re-render the component if getSnapshot return value is different from the last time. This is why, if you always return a different value, you will enter an infinite loop and get this error.\n\nYour getSnapshot object should only return a different object if something has actually changed. If your store contains immutable data, you can return that data directly:\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n\n  // ✅ You can return immutable data\n\n  return myStore.todos;\n\n}\n\nIf your store data is mutable, your getSnapshot function should return an immutable snapshot of it. This means it does need to create new objects, but it shouldn’t do this for every single call. Instead, it should store the last calculated snapshot, and return the same snapshot as the last time if the data in the store has not changed. How you determine whether mutable data has changed depends on your mutable store.\n\nMy subscribe function gets called after every re-render \n\nThis subscribe function is defined inside a component so it is different on every re-render:\n\nfunction ChatIndicator() {\n\n  // 🚩 Always a different function, so React will resubscribe on every re-render\n\n  function subscribe() {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n  \n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nReact will resubscribe to your store if you pass a different subscribe function between re-renders. If this causes performance issues and you’d like to avoid resubscribing, move the subscribe function outside:\n\n// ✅ Always the same function, so React won't need to resubscribe\n\nfunction subscribe() {\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction ChatIndicator() {\n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, wrap subscribe into useCallback to only resubscribe when some argument changes:\n\nfunction ChatIndicator({ userId }) {\n\n  // ✅ Same function as long as userId doesn't change\n\n  const subscribe = useCallback(() => {\n\n    // ...\n\n  }, [userId]);\n\n  \n\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\nuseState\nNEXT\nuseTransition"

React calls action immediately with no parameters and marks all state updates scheduled synchronously during the action function call as Transitions. Any async calls that are awaited in the action will be included in the Transition, but currently require wrapping any set functions after the await in an additional startTransition (see Troubleshooting). State updates marked as Transitions will be non-blocking and will not display unwanted loading indicators.\nReturns \n\nstartTransition does not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nuseTransition is a Hook, so it can only be called inside components or custom Hooks. If you need to start a Transition somewhere else (for example, from a data library), call the standalone startTransition instead.\n\nYou can wrap an update into a Transition only if you have access to the set function of that state. If you want to start a Transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook value, try useDeferredValue instead.\n\nThe function you pass to startTransition is called immediately, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as Transitions. If you try to perform state updates in a setTimeout, for example, they won’t be marked as Transitions.\n\nYou must wrap any state updates after any async requests in another startTransition to mark them as Transitions. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see Troubleshooting).\n\nThe startTransition function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.\n\nA state update marked as a Transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a Transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input update.\n\nTransition updates can’t be used to control text inputs.\n\nIf there are multiple ongoing Transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation that may be removed in a future release.\n\nUsage \nPerform non-blocking updates with Actions \n\nCall useTransition at the top of your component to create Actions, and access the pending state:\n\nimport {useState, useTransition} from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction CheckoutForm() {\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nuseTransition returns an array with exactly two items:\n\nThe isPending flag that tells you whether there is a pending Transition.\nThe startTransition function that lets you create an Action.\n\nTo start a Transition, pass a function to startTransition like this:\n\nimport {useState, useTransition} from 'react';\n\nimport {updateQuantity} from './api';\n\n\n\nfunction CheckoutForm() {\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);\n\n\n\n  function onSubmit(newQuantity) {\n\n    startTransition(async function () {\n\n      const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity);\n\n      startTransition(() => {\n\n        setQuantity(savedQuantity);\n\n      });\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThe function passed to startTransition is called the “Action”. You can update state and (optionally) perform side effects within an Action, and the work will be done in the background without blocking user interactions on the page. A Transition can include multiple Actions, and while a Transition is in progress, your UI stays responsive. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then changes their mind and clicks another tab, the second click will be immediately handled without waiting for the first update to finish.\n\nTo give the user feedback about in-progress Transitions, the isPending state switches to true at the first call to startTransition, and stays true until all Actions complete and the final state is shown to the user. Transitions ensure side effects in Actions to complete in order to prevent unwanted loading indicators, and you can provide immediate feedback while the Transition is in progress with useOptimistic.\n\nThe difference between Actions and regular event handling\n1. Updating the quantity in an Action\n2. Updating the quantity without an Action\nExample 1 of 2: Updating the quantity in an Action \n\nIn this example, the updateQuantity function simulates a request to the server to update the item’s quantity in the cart. This function is artificially slowed down so that it takes at least a second to complete the request.\n\nUpdate the quantity multiple times quickly. Notice that the pending “Total” state is shown while any requests are in progress, and the “Total” updates only after the final request is complete. Because the update is in an Action, the “quantity” can continue to be updated while the request is in progress.\n\nApp.js\nItem.js\nTotal.js\napi.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useTransition } from \"react\";\nimport { updateQuantity } from \"./api\";\nimport Item from \"./Item\";\nimport Total from \"./Total\";\n\nexport default function App({}) {\n  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  const updateQuantityAction = async newQuantity => {\n    // To access the pending state of a transition,\n    // call startTransition again.\n    startTransition(async () => {\n      const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity);\n      startTransition(() => {\n        setQuantity(savedQuantity);\n      });\n    });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Checkout</h1>\n      <Item action={updateQuantityAction}/>\n      <hr />\n      <Total quantity={quantity} isPending={isPending} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis is a basic example to demonstrate how Actions work, but this example does not handle requests completing out of order. When updating the quantity multiple times, it’s possible for the previous requests to finish after later requests causing the quantity to update out of order. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see Troubleshooting below).\n\nFor common use cases, React provides built-in abstractions such as:\n\nuseActionState\n<form> actions\nServer Functions\n\nThese solutions handle request ordering for you. When using Transitions to build your own custom hooks or libraries that manage async state transitions, you have greater control over the request ordering, but you must handle it yourself.\n\nNext Example\nExposing action prop from components \n\nYou can expose an action prop from a component to allow a parent to call an Action.\n\nFor example, this TabButton component wraps its onClick logic in an action prop:\n\nexport default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  if (isActive) {\n\n    return <b>{children}</b>\n\n  }\n\n  return (\n\n    <button onClick={() => {\n\n      startTransition(async () => {\n\n        // await the action that's passed in.\n\n        // This allows it to be either sync or async.\n\n        await action();\n\n      });\n\n    }}>\n\n      {children}\n\n    </button>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nBecause the parent component updates its state inside the action, that state update gets marked as a Transition. This means you can click on “Posts” and then immediately click “Contact” and it does not block user interactions:\n\nApp.js\nTabButton.js\nAboutTab.js\nPostsTab.js\nContactTab.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useTransition } from 'react';\n\nexport default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n  if (isActive) {\n    return <b>{children}</b>\n  }\n  if (isPending) {\n    return <b className=\"pending\">{children}</b>;\n  }\n  return (\n    <button onClick={async () => {\n      startTransition(async () => {\n        // await the action that's passed in.\n        // This allows it to be either sync or async.\n        await action();\n      });\n    }}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nWhen exposing an action prop from a component, you should await it inside the transition.\n\nThis allows the action callback to be either synchronous or asynchronous without requiring an additional startTransition to wrap the await in the action.\n\nDisplaying a pending visual state \n\nYou can use the isPending boolean value returned by useTransition to indicate to the user that a Transition is in progress. For example, the tab button can have a special “pending” visual state:\n\nfunction TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  // ...\n\n  if (isPending) {\n\n    return <b className=\"pending\">{children}</b>;\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nNotice how clicking “Posts” now feels more responsive because the tab button itself updates right away:\n\nApp.js\nTabButton.js\nAboutTab.js\nPostsTab.js\nContactTab.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useTransition } from 'react';\n\nexport default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n  if (isActive) {\n    return <b>{children}</b>\n  }\n  if (isPending) {\n    return <b className=\"pending\">{children}</b>;\n  }\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => {\n      startTransition(async () => {\n        await action();\n      });\n    }}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPreventing unwanted loading indicators \n\nIn this example, the PostsTab component fetches some data using use. When you click the “Posts” tab, the PostsTab component suspends, causing the closest loading fallback to appear:\n\nApp.js\nTabButton.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState } from 'react';\nimport TabButton from './TabButton.js';\nimport AboutTab from './AboutTab.js';\nimport PostsTab from './PostsTab.js';\nimport ContactTab from './ContactTab.js';\n\nexport default function TabContainer() {\n  const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<h1>🌀 Loading...</h1>}>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={tab === 'about'}\n        action={() => setTab('about')}\n      >\n        About\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={tab === 'posts'}\n        action={() => setTab('posts')}\n      >\n        Posts\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={tab === 'contact'}\n        action={() => setTab('contact')}\n      >\n        Contact\n      </TabButton>\n      <hr />\n      {tab === 'about' && <AboutTab />}\n      {tab === 'posts' && <PostsTab />}\n      {tab === 'contact' && <ContactTab />}\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHiding the entire tab container to show a loading indicator leads to a jarring user experience. If you add useTransition to TabButton, you can instead display the pending state in the tab button instead.\n\nNotice that clicking “Posts” no longer replaces the entire tab container with a spinner:\n\nApp.js\nTabButton.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useTransition } from 'react';\n\nexport default function TabButton({ action, children, isActive }) {\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n  if (isActive) {\n    return <b>{children}</b>\n  }\n  if (isPending) {\n    return <b className=\"pending\">{children}</b>;\n  }\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => {\n      startTransition(async () => {\n        await action();\n      });\n    }}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nRead more about using Transitions with Suspense.\n\nNote\n\nTransitions only “wait” long enough to avoid hiding already revealed content (like the tab container). If the Posts tab had a nested <Suspense> boundary, the Transition would not “wait” for it.\n\nBuilding a Suspense-enabled router \n\nIf you’re building a React framework or a router, we recommend marking page navigations as Transitions.\n\nfunction Router() {\n\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n\n    startTransition(() => {\n\n      setPage(url);\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nThis is recommended for three reasons:\n\nTransitions are interruptible, which lets the user click away without waiting for the re-render to complete.\nTransitions prevent unwanted loading indicators, which lets the user avoid jarring jumps on navigation.\nTransitions wait for all pending actions which lets the user wait for side effects to complete before the new page is shown.\n\nHere is a simplified router example using Transitions for navigations.\n\nApp.js\nLayout.js\nIndexPage.js\nArtistPage.js\nAlbums.js\nBiography.js\nPanel.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useTransition } from 'react';\nimport IndexPage from './IndexPage.js';\nimport ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js';\nimport Layout from './Layout.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n      <Router />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Router() {\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setPage(url);\n    });\n  }\n\n  let content;\n  if (page === '/') {\n    content = (\n      <IndexPage navigate={navigate} />\n    );\n  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {\n    content = (\n      <ArtistPage\n        artist={{\n          id: 'the-beatles',\n          name: 'The Beatles',\n        }}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <Layout isPending={isPending}>\n      {content}\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nSuspense-enabled routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into Transitions by default.\n\nDisplaying an error to users with an error boundary \n\nIf a function passed to startTransition throws an error, you can display an error to your user with an error boundary. To use an error boundary, wrap the component where you are calling the useTransition in an error boundary. Once the function passed to startTransition errors, the fallback for the error boundary will be displayed.\n\nAddCommentContainer.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useTransition } from \"react\";\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\nexport function AddCommentContainer() {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>⚠️Something went wrong</p>}>\n      <AddCommentButton />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction addComment(comment) {\n  // For demonstration purposes to show Error Boundary\n  if (comment == null) {\n    throw new Error(\"Example Error: An error thrown to trigger error boundary\");\n  }\n}\n\nfunction AddCommentButton() {\n  const [pending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      disabled={pending}\n      onClick={() => {\n        startTransition(() => {\n          // Intentionally not passing a comment\n          // so error gets thrown\n          addComment();\n        });\n      }}\n    >\n      Add comment\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nTroubleshooting \nUpdating an input in a Transition doesn’t work \n\nYou can’t use a Transition for a state variable that controls an input:\n\nconst [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n// ...\n\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n\n  // ❌ Can't use Transitions for controlled input state\n\n  startTransition(() => {\n\n    setText(e.target.value);\n\n  });\n\n}\n\n// ...\n\nreturn <input value={text} onChange={handleChange} />;\n\nThis is because Transitions are non-blocking, but updating an input in response to the change event should happen synchronously. If you want to run a Transition in response to typing, you have two options:\n\nYou can declare two separate state variables: one for the input state (which always updates synchronously), and one that you will update in a Transition. This lets you control the input using the synchronous state, and pass the Transition state variable (which will “lag behind” the input) to the rest of your rendering logic.\nAlternatively, you can have one state variable, and add useDeferredValue which will “lag behind” the real value. It will trigger non-blocking re-renders to “catch up” with the new value automatically.\nReact doesn’t treat my state update as a Transition \n\nWhen you wrap a state update in a Transition, make sure that it happens during the startTransition call:\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  // ✅ Setting state *during* startTransition call\n\n  setPage('/about');\n\n});\n\nThe function you pass to startTransition must be synchronous. You can’t mark an update as a Transition like this:\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  // ❌ Setting state *after* startTransition call\n\n  setTimeout(() => {\n\n    setPage('/about');\n\n  }, 1000);\n\n});\n\nInstead, you could do this:\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n\n  startTransition(() => {\n\n    // ✅ Setting state *during* startTransition call\n\n    setPage('/about');\n\n  });\n\n}, 1000);\nReact doesn’t treat my state update after await as a Transition \n\nWhen you use await inside a startTransition function, the state updates that happen after the await are not marked as Transitions. You must wrap state updates after each await in a startTransition call:\n\nstartTransition(async () => {\n\n  await someAsyncFunction();\n\n  // ❌ Not using startTransition after await\n\n  setPage('/about');\n\n});\n\nHowever, this works instead:\n\nstartTransition(async () => {\n\n  await someAsyncFunction();\n\n  // ✅ Using startTransition *after* await\n\n  startTransition(() => {\n\n    setPage('/about');\n\n  });\n\n});\n\nThis is a JavaScript limitation due to React losing the scope of the async context. In the future, when AsyncContext is available, this limitation will be removed.\n\nI want to call useTransition from outside a component \n\nYou can’t call useTransition outside a component because it’s a Hook. In this case, use the standalone startTransition method instead. It works the same way, but it doesn’t provide the isPending indicator.\n\nThe function I pass to startTransition executes immediately \n\nIf you run this code, it will print 1, 2, 3:\n\nconsole.log(1);\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  console.log(2);\n\n  setPage('/about');\n\n});\n\nconsole.log(3);\n\nIt is expected to print 1, 2, 3. The function you pass to startTransition does not get delayed. Unlike with the browser setTimeout, it does not run the callback later. React executes your function immediately, but any state updates scheduled while it is running are marked as Transitions. You can imagine that it works like this:\n\n// A simplified version of how React works\n\n\n\nlet isInsideTransition = false;\n\n\n\nfunction startTransition(scope) {\n\n  isInsideTransition = true;\n\n  scope();\n\n  isInsideTransition = false;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction setState() {\n\n  if (isInsideTransition) {\n\n    // ... schedule a Transition state update ...\n\n  } else {\n\n    // ... schedule an urgent state update ...\n\n  }\n\n}\nMy state updates in Transitions are out of order \n\nIf you await inside startTransition, you might see the updates happen out of order.\n\nIn this example, the updateQuantity function simulates a request to the server to update the item’s quantity in the cart. This function artificially returns every other request after the previous to simulate race conditions for network requests.\n\nTry updating the quantity once, then update it quickly multiple times. You might see the incorrect total:\n\nApp.js\nItem.js\nTotal.js\napi.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useTransition } from \"react\";\nimport { updateQuantity } from \"./api\";\nimport Item from \"./Item\";\nimport Total from \"./Total\";\n\nexport default function App({}) {\n  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n  // Store the actual quantity in separate state to show the mismatch.\n  const [clientQuantity, setClientQuantity] = useState(1);\n\n  const updateQuantityAction = newQuantity => {\n    setClientQuantity(newQuantity);\n\n    // Access the pending state of the transition,\n    // by wrapping in startTransition again.\n    startTransition(async () => {\n      const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(newQuantity);\n      startTransition(() => {\n        setQuantity(savedQuantity);\n      });\n    });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Checkout</h1>\n      <Item action={updateQuantityAction}/>\n      <hr />\n      <Total clientQuantity={clientQuantity} savedQuantity={quantity} isPending={isPending} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen clicking multiple times, it’s possible for previous requests to finish after later requests. When this happens, React currently has no way to know the intended order. This is because the updates are scheduled asynchronously, and React loses context of the order across the async boundary.\n\nThis is expected, because Actions within a Transition do not guarantee execution order. For common use cases, React provides higher-level abstractions like useActionState and <form> actions that handle ordering for you. For advanced use cases, you’ll need to implement your own queuing and abort logic to handle this.\n\nExample of useActionState handling execution order:\n\nApp.js\nItem.js\nTotal.js\napi.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useActionState } from \"react\";\nimport { updateQuantity } from \"./api\";\nimport Item from \"./Item\";\nimport Total from \"./Total\";\n\nexport default function App({}) {\n  // Store the actual quantity in separate state to show the mismatch.\n  const [clientQuantity, setClientQuantity] = useState(1);\n  const [quantity, updateQuantityAction, isPending] = useActionState(\n    async (prevState, payload) => {\n      setClientQuantity(payload);\n      const savedQuantity = await updateQuantity(payload);\n      return savedQuantity; // Return the new quantity to update the state\n    },\n    1 // Initial quantity\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Checkout</h1>\n      <Item action={updateQuantityAction}/>\n      <hr />\n      <Total clientQuantity={clientQuantity} savedQuantity={quantity} isPending={isPending} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPREVIOUS\nuseSyncExternalStore\nNEXT\nComponents"

Grouping elements in Fragment has no effect on the resulting DOM; it is the same as if the elements were not grouped. The empty JSX tag <></> is shorthand for <Fragment></Fragment> in most cases.\n\nProps \noptional key: Fragments declared with the explicit <Fragment> syntax may have keys.\nCanary only optional ref: A ref object (e.g. from useRef) or callback function. React provides a FragmentInstance as the ref value that implements methods for interacting with the DOM nodes wrapped by the Fragment.\nCanary only FragmentInstance \n\nWhen you pass a ref to a fragment, React provides a FragmentInstance object with methods for interacting with the DOM nodes wrapped by the fragment:\n\nEvent handling methods:\n\naddEventListener(type, listener, options?): Adds an event listener to all first-level DOM children of the Fragment.\nremoveEventListener(type, listener, options?): Removes an event listener from all first-level DOM children of the Fragment.\ndispatchEvent(event): Dispatches an event to a virtual child of the Fragment to call any added listeners and can bubble to the DOM parent.\n\nLayout methods:\n\ncompareDocumentPosition(otherNode): Compares the document position of the Fragment with another node.\nIf the Fragment has children, the native compareDocumentPosition value is returned.\nEmpty Fragments will attempt to compare positioning within the React tree and include Node.DOCUMENT_POSITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC.\nElements that have a different relationship in the React tree and DOM tree due to portaling or other insertions are Node.DOCUMENT_POSITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC.\ngetClientRects(): Returns a flat array of DOMRect objects representing the bounding rectangles of all children.\ngetRootNode(): Returns the root node containing the Fragment’s parent DOM node.\n\nFocus management methods:\n\nfocus(options?): Focuses the first focusable DOM node in the Fragment. Focus is attempted on nested children depth-first.\nfocusLast(options?): Focuses the last focusable DOM node in the Fragment. Focus is attempted on nested children depth-first.\nblur(): Removes focus if document.activeElement is within the Fragment.\n\nObserver methods:\n\nobserveUsing(observer): Starts observing the Fragment’s DOM children with an IntersectionObserver or ResizeObserver.\nunobserveUsing(observer): Stops observing the Fragment’s DOM children with the specified observer.\nCaveats \n\nIf you want to pass key to a Fragment, you can’t use the <>...</> syntax. You have to explicitly import Fragment from 'react' and render <Fragment key={yourKey}>...</Fragment>.\n\nReact does not reset state when you go from rendering <><Child /></> to [<Child />] or back, or when you go from rendering <><Child /></> to <Child /> and back. This only works a single level deep: for example, going from <><><Child /></></> to <Child /> resets the state. See the precise semantics here.\n\nCanary only If you want to pass ref to a Fragment, you can’t use the <>...</> syntax. You have to explicitly import Fragment from 'react' and render <Fragment ref={yourRef}>...</Fragment>.\n\nUsage \nReturning multiple elements \n\nUse Fragment, or the equivalent <>...</> syntax, to group multiple elements together. You can use it to put multiple elements in any place where a single element can go. For example, a component can only return one element, but by using a Fragment you can group multiple elements together and then return them as a group:\n\nfunction Post() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <PostTitle />\n\n      <PostBody />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nFragments are useful because grouping elements with a Fragment has no effect on layout or styles, unlike if you wrapped the elements in another container like a DOM element. If you inspect this example with the browser tools, you’ll see that all <h1> and <article> DOM nodes appear as siblings without wrappers around them:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function Blog() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Post title=\"An update\" body=\"It's been a while since I posted...\" />\n      <Post title=\"My new blog\" body=\"I am starting a new blog!\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Post({ title, body }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <PostTitle title={title} />\n      <PostBody body={body} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction PostTitle({ title }) {\n  return <h1>{title}</h1>\n}\n\nfunction PostBody({ body }) {\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <p>{body}</p>\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nDEEP DIVE\nHow to write a Fragment without the special syntax? \nShow Details\nAssigning multiple elements to a variable \n\nLike any other element, you can assign Fragment elements to variables, pass them as props, and so on:\n\nfunction CloseDialog() {\n\n  const buttons = (\n\n    <>\n\n      <OKButton />\n\n      <CancelButton />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n  return (\n\n    <AlertDialog buttons={buttons}>\n\n      Are you sure you want to leave this page?\n\n    </AlertDialog>\n\n  );\n\n}\nGrouping elements with text \n\nYou can use Fragment to group text together with components:\n\nfunction DateRangePicker({ start, end }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      From\n\n      <DatePicker date={start} />\n\n      to\n\n      <DatePicker date={end} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nRendering a list of Fragments \n\nHere’s a situation where you need to write Fragment explicitly instead of using the <></> syntax. When you render multiple elements in a loop, you need to assign a key to each element. If the elements within the loop are Fragments, you need to use the normal JSX element syntax in order to provide the key attribute:\n\nfunction Blog() {\n\n  return posts.map(post =>\n\n    <Fragment key={post.id}>\n\n      <PostTitle title={post.title} />\n\n      <PostBody body={post.body} />\n\n    </Fragment>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nYou can inspect the DOM to verify that there are no wrapper elements around the Fragment children:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Fragment } from 'react';\n\nconst posts = [\n  { id: 1, title: 'An update', body: \"It's been a while since I posted...\" },\n  { id: 2, title: 'My new blog', body: 'I am starting a new blog!' }\n];\n\nexport default function Blog() {\n  return posts.map(post =>\n    <Fragment key={post.id}>\n      <PostTitle title={post.title} />\n      <PostBody body={post.body} />\n    </Fragment>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction PostTitle({ title }) {\n  return <h1>{title}</h1>\n}\n\nfunction PostBody({ body }) {\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <p>{body}</p>\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nCanary only Using Fragment refs for DOM interaction \n\nFragment refs allow you to interact with the DOM nodes wrapped by a Fragment without adding extra wrapper elements. This is useful for event handling, visibility tracking, focus management, and replacing deprecated patterns like ReactDOM.findDOMNode().\n\nimport { Fragment } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ClickableFragment({ children, onClick }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <Fragment ref={fragmentInstance => {\n\n      fragmentInstance.addEventListener('click', handleClick);\n\n      return () => fragmentInstance.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);\n\n    }}>\n\n      {children}\n\n    </Fragment>\n\n  );\n\n}\nCanary only Tracking visibility with Fragment refs \n\nFragment refs are useful for visibility tracking and intersection observation. This enables you to monitor when content becomes visible without requiring the child Components to expose refs:\n\nimport { Fragment, useRef, useLayoutEffect } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction VisibilityObserverFragment({ threshold = 0.5, onVisibilityChange, children }) {\n\n  const fragmentRef = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n\n    const observer = new IntersectionObserver(\n\n      (entries) => {\n\n        onVisibilityChange(entries.some(entry => entry.isIntersecting))\n\n      },\n\n      { threshold }\n\n    );\n\n    \n\n    fragmentRef.current.observeUsing(observer);\n\n    return () => fragmentRef.current.unobserveUsing(observer);\n\n  }, [threshold, onVisibilityChange]);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <Fragment ref={fragmentRef}>\n\n      {children}\n\n    </Fragment>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n\n  const handleVisibilityChange = (isVisible) => {\n\n    console.log('Component is', isVisible ? 'visible' : 'hidden');\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <VisibilityObserverFragment onVisibilityChange={handleVisibilityChange}>\n\n      <SomeThirdPartyComponent />\n\n      <AnotherComponent />\n\n    </VisibilityObserverFragment>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis pattern is an alternative to Effect-based visibility logging, which is an anti-pattern in most cases. Relying on Effects alone does not guarantee that the rendered Component is observable by the user.\n\nCanary only Focus management with Fragment refs \n\nFragment refs provide focus management methods that work across all DOM nodes within the Fragment:\n\nimport { Fragment, useRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction FocusFragment({ children }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <Fragment ref={(fragmentInstance) => fragmentInstance?.focus()}>\n\n      {children}\n\n    </Fragment>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe focus() method focuses the first focusable element within the Fragment, while focusLast() focuses the last focusable element.\n\nPREVIOUS\nComponents\nNEXT\n<Profiler>"

It exposes similar functionality as a browser extension.\n\nComponents wrapped in <Profiler> will also be marked in the Component tracks of React Performance tracks even in profiling builds.\nIn development builds, all components are marked in the Components track regardless of whether they’re wrapped in <Profiler>.\n\nMeasuring different parts of the application \n\nYou can use multiple <Profiler> components to measure different parts of your application:\n\n<App>\n\n  <Profiler id=\"Sidebar\" onRender={onRender}>\n\n    <Sidebar />\n\n  </Profiler>\n\n  <Profiler id=\"Content\" onRender={onRender}>\n\n    <Content />\n\n  </Profiler>\n\n</App>\n\nYou can also nest <Profiler> components:\n\n<App>\n\n  <Profiler id=\"Sidebar\" onRender={onRender}>\n\n    <Sidebar />\n\n  </Profiler>\n\n  <Profiler id=\"Content\" onRender={onRender}>\n\n    <Content>\n\n      <Profiler id=\"Editor\" onRender={onRender}>\n\n        <Editor />\n\n      </Profiler>\n\n      <Preview />\n\n    </Content>\n\n  </Profiler>\n\n</App>\n\nAlthough <Profiler> is a lightweight component, it should be used only when necessary. Each use adds some CPU and memory overhead to an application.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<Fragment> (<>)\nNEXT\n<StrictMode>"

    "html": "API REFERENCE\nCOMPONENTS\n<StrictMode>\n\n<StrictMode> lets you find common bugs in your components early during development.\n\n<StrictMode>\n\n  <App />\n\n</StrictMode>\nReference\n<StrictMode>\nUsage\nEnabling Strict Mode for entire app\nEnabling Strict Mode for a part of the app\nFixing bugs found by double rendering in development\nFixing bugs found by re-running Effects in development\nFixing bugs found by re-running ref callbacks in development\nFixing deprecation warnings enabled by Strict Mode\nReference \n<StrictMode> \n\nUse StrictMode to enable additional development behaviors and warnings for the component tree inside:\n\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\n\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\n\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\n\nroot.render(\n\n  <StrictMode>\n\n    <App />\n\n  </StrictMode>\n\n);\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nStrict Mode enables the following development-only behaviors:\n\nYour components will re-render an extra time to find bugs caused by impure rendering.\nYour components will re-run Effects an extra time to find bugs caused by missing Effect cleanup.\nYour components will re-run refs callbacks an extra time to find bugs caused by missing ref cleanup.\nYour components will be checked for usage of deprecated APIs.\nProps \n\nStrictMode accepts no props.\n\nCaveats \nThere is no way to opt out of Strict Mode inside a tree wrapped in <StrictMode>. This gives you confidence that all components inside <StrictMode> are checked. If two teams working on a product disagree whether they find the checks valuable, they need to either reach consensus or move <StrictMode> down in the tree.\nUsage \nEnabling Strict Mode for entire app \n\nStrict Mode enables extra development-only checks for the entire component tree inside the <StrictMode> component. These checks help you find common bugs in your components early in the development process.\n\nTo enable Strict Mode for your entire app, wrap your root component with <StrictMode> when you render it:\n\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\n\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\n\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\n\nroot.render(\n\n  <StrictMode>\n\n    <App />\n\n  </StrictMode>\n\n);\n\nWe recommend wrapping your entire app in Strict Mode, especially for newly created apps. If you use a framework that calls createRoot for you, check its documentation for how to enable Strict Mode.\n\nAlthough the Strict Mode checks only run in development, they help you find bugs that already exist in your code but can be tricky to reliably reproduce in production. Strict Mode lets you fix bugs before your users report them.\n\nNote\n\nStrict Mode enables the following checks in development:\n\nYour components will re-render an extra time to find bugs caused by impure rendering.\nYour components will re-run Effects an extra time to find bugs caused by missing Effect cleanup.\nYour components will re-run ref callbacks an extra time to find bugs caused by missing ref cleanup.\nYour components will be checked for usage of deprecated APIs.\n\nAll of these checks are development-only and do not impact the production build.\n\nEnabling Strict Mode for a part of the app \n\nYou can also enable Strict Mode for any part of your application:\n\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <Header />\n\n      <StrictMode>\n\n        <main>\n\n          <Sidebar />\n\n          <Content />\n\n        </main>\n\n      </StrictMode>\n\n      <Footer />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn this example, Strict Mode checks will not run against the Header and Footer components. However, they will run on Sidebar and Content, as well as all of the components inside them, no matter how deep.\n\nNote\n\nWhen StrictMode is enabled for a part of the app, React will only enable behaviors that are possible in production. For example, if <StrictMode> is not enabled at the root of the app, it will not re-run Effects an extra time on initial mount, since this would cause child effects to double fire without the parent effects, which cannot happen in production.\n\nFixing bugs found by double rendering in development \n\nReact assumes that every component you write is a pure function. This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs (props, state, and context).\n\nComponents breaking this rule behave unpredictably and cause bugs. To help you find accidentally impure code, Strict Mode calls some of your functions (only the ones that should be pure) twice in development. This includes:\n\nYour component function body (only top-level logic, so this doesn’t include code inside event handlers)\nFunctions that you pass to useState, set functions, useMemo, or useReducer\nSome class component methods like constructor, render, shouldComponentUpdate (see the whole list)\n\nIf a function is pure, running it twice does not change its behavior because a pure function produces the same result every time. However, if a function is impure (for example, it mutates the data it receives), running it twice tends to be noticeable (that’s what makes it impure!) This helps you spot and fix the bug early.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate how double rendering in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early.\n\nThis StoryTray component takes an array of stories and adds one last “Create Story” item at the end:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nStoryTray.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n  const items = stories;\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(story => (\n        <li key={story.id}>\n          {story.label}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThere is a mistake in the code above. However, it is easy to miss because the initial output appears correct.\n\nThis mistake will become more noticeable if the StoryTray component re-renders multiple times. For example, let’s make the StoryTray re-render with a different background color whenever you hover over it:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nStoryTray.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n  const [isHover, setIsHover] = useState(false);\n  const items = stories;\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n  return (\n    <ul\n      onPointerEnter={() => setIsHover(true)}\n      onPointerLeave={() => setIsHover(false)}\n      style={{\n        backgroundColor: isHover ? '#ddd' : '#fff'\n      }}\n    >\n      {items.map(story => (\n        <li key={story.id}>\n          {story.label}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNotice how every time you hover over the StoryTray component, “Create Story” gets added to the list again. The intention of the code was to add it once at the end. But StoryTray directly modifies the stories array from the props. Every time StoryTray renders, it adds “Create Story” again at the end of the same array. In other words, StoryTray is not a pure function—running it multiple times produces different results.\n\nTo fix this problem, you can make a copy of the array, and modify that copy instead of the original one:\n\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n\n  const items = stories.slice(); // Clone the array\n\n  // ✅ Good: Pushing into a new array\n\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n\nThis would make the StoryTray function pure. Each time it is called, it would only modify a new copy of the array, and would not affect any external objects or variables. This solves the bug, but you had to make the component re-render more often before it became obvious that something is wrong with its behavior.\n\nIn the original example, the bug wasn’t obvious. Now let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in <StrictMode>:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nStoryTray.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n  const items = stories;\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(story => (\n        <li key={story.id}>\n          {story.label}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nStrict Mode always calls your rendering function twice, so you can see the mistake right away (“Create Story” appears twice). This lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your component to render in Strict Mode, you also fix many possible future production bugs like the hover functionality from before:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nStoryTray.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function StoryTray({ stories }) {\n  const [isHover, setIsHover] = useState(false);\n  const items = stories.slice(); // Clone the array\n  items.push({ id: 'create', label: 'Create Story' });\n  return (\n    <ul\n      onPointerEnter={() => setIsHover(true)}\n      onPointerLeave={() => setIsHover(false)}\n      style={{\n        backgroundColor: isHover ? '#ddd' : '#fff'\n      }}\n    >\n      {items.map(story => (\n        <li key={story.id}>\n          {story.label}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWithout Strict Mode, it was easy to miss the bug until you added more re-renders. Strict Mode made the same bug appear right away. Strict Mode helps you find bugs before you push them to your team and to your users.\n\nRead more about keeping components pure.\n\nNote\n\nIf you have React DevTools installed, any console.log calls during the second render call will appear slightly dimmed. React DevTools also offers a setting (off by default) to suppress them completely.\n\nFixing bugs found by re-running Effects in development \n\nStrict Mode can also help find bugs in Effects.\n\nEvery Effect has some setup code and may have some cleanup code. Normally, React calls setup when the component mounts (is added to the screen) and calls cleanup when the component unmounts (is removed from the screen). React then calls cleanup and setup again if its dependencies changed since the last render.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will also run one extra setup+cleanup cycle in development for every Effect. This may feel surprising, but it helps reveal subtle bugs that are hard to catch manually.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate how re-running Effects in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early.\n\nConsider this example that connects a component to a chat:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport './styles.css';\n\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\"));\nroot.render(<App />);\n\n\n\nThere is an issue with this code, but it might not be immediately clear.\n\nTo make the issue more obvious, let’s implement a feature. In the example below, roomId is not hardcoded. Instead, the user can select the roomId that they want to connect to from a dropdown. Click “Open chat” and then select different chat rooms one by one. Keep track of the number of active connections in the console:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport './styles.css';\n\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\"));\nroot.render(<App />);\n\n\n\nYou’ll notice that the number of open connections always keeps growing. In a real app, this would cause performance and network problems. The issue is that your Effect is missing a cleanup function:\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n\n  }, [roomId]);\n\nNow that your Effect “cleans up” after itself and destroys the outdated connections, the leak is solved. However, notice that the problem did not become visible until you’ve added more features (the select box).\n\nIn the original example, the bug wasn’t obvious. Now let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in <StrictMode>:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport './styles.css';\n\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\"));\nroot.render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </StrictMode>\n);\n\n\n\nWith Strict Mode, you immediately see that there is a problem (the number of active connections jumps to 2). Strict Mode runs an extra setup+cleanup cycle for every Effect. This Effect has no cleanup logic, so it creates an extra connection but doesn’t destroy it. This is a hint that you’re missing a cleanup function.\n\nStrict Mode lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your Effect by adding a cleanup function in Strict Mode, you also fix many possible future production bugs like the select box from before:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react';\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\nimport './styles.css';\n\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\"));\nroot.render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </StrictMode>\n);\n\n\n\nNotice how the active connection count in the console doesn’t keep growing anymore.\n\nWithout Strict Mode, it was easy to miss that your Effect needed cleanup. By running setup → cleanup → setup instead of setup for your Effect in development, Strict Mode made the missing cleanup logic more noticeable.\n\nRead more about implementing Effect cleanup.\n\nFixing bugs found by re-running ref callbacks in development \n\nStrict Mode can also help find bugs in callbacks refs.\n\nEvery callback ref has some setup code and may have some cleanup code. Normally, React calls setup when the element is created (is added to the DOM) and calls cleanup when the element is removed (is removed from the DOM).\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will also run one extra setup+cleanup cycle in development for every callback ref. This may feel surprising, but it helps reveal subtle bugs that are hard to catch manually.\n\nConsider this example, which allows you to select an animal and then scroll to one of them. Notice when you switch from “Cats” to “Dogs”, the console logs show that the number of animals in the list keeps growing, and the “Scroll to” buttons stop working:\n\nindex.js\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef, useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function CatFriends() {\n  const itemsRef = useRef([]);\n  const [catList, setCatList] = useState(setupCatList);\n  const [cat, setCat] = useState('neo');\n\n  function scrollToCat(index) {\n    const list = itemsRef.current;\n    const {node} = list[index];\n    node.scrollIntoView({\n      behavior: \"smooth\",\n      block: \"nearest\",\n      inline: \"center\",\n    });\n  }\n\n  const cats = catList.filter(c => c.type === cat)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <nav>\n        <button onClick={() => setCat('neo')}>Neo</button>\n        <button onClick={() => setCat('millie')}>Millie</button>\n      </nav>\n      <hr />\n      <nav>\n        <span>Scroll to:</span>{cats.map((cat, index) => (\n          <button key={cat.src} onClick={() => scrollToCat(index)}>\n            {index}\n          </button>\n        ))}\n      </nav>\n      <div>\n        <ul>\n          {cats.map((cat) => (\n            <li\n              key={cat.src}\n              ref={(node) => {\n                const list = itemsRef.current;\n                const item = {cat: cat, node};\n                list.push(item);\n                console.log(`✅ Adding cat to the map. Total cats: ${list.length}`);\n                if (list.length > 10) {\n                  console.log('❌ Too many cats in the list!');\n                }\n                return () => {\n                  // 🚩 No cleanup, this is a bug!\n                }\n              }}\n            >\n              <img src={cat.src} />\n            </li>\n          ))}\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction setupCatList() {\n  const catList = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n    catList.push({type: 'neo', src: \"https://placecats.com/neo/320/240?\" + i});\n  }\n  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n    catList.push({type: 'millie', src: \"https://placecats.com/millie/320/240?\" + i});\n  }\n\n  return catList;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis is a production bug! Since the ref callback doesn’t remove animals from the list in the cleanup, the list of animals keeps growing.

If children suspends while rendering, the Suspense boundary will switch to rendering fallback.\nfallback: An alternate UI to render in place of the actual UI if it has not finished loading. Any valid React node is accepted, though in practice, a fallback is a lightweight placeholder view, such as a loading spinner or skeleton. Suspense will automatically switch to fallback when children suspends, and back to children when the data is ready. If fallback suspends while rendering, it will activate the closest parent Suspense boundary.\nCaveats \nReact does not preserve any state for renders that got suspended before they were able to mount for the first time. When the component has loaded, React will retry rendering the suspended tree from scratch.\nIf Suspense was displaying content for the tree, but then it suspended again, the fallback will be shown again unless the update causing it was caused by startTransition or useDeferredValue.\nIf React needs to hide the already visible content because it suspended again, it will clean up layout Effects in the content tree. When the content is ready to be shown again, React will fire the layout Effects again. This ensures that Effects measuring the DOM layout don’t try to do this while the content is hidden.\nReact includes under-the-hood optimizations like Streaming Server Rendering and Selective Hydration that are integrated with Suspense. Read an architectural overview and watch a technical talk to learn more.\nUsage \nDisplaying a fallback while content is loading \n\nYou can wrap any part of your application with a Suspense boundary:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <Albums />\n\n</Suspense>\n\nReact will display your loading fallback until all the code and data needed by the children has been loaded.\n\nIn the example below, the Albums component suspends while fetching the list of albums. Until it’s ready to render, React switches the closest Suspense boundary above to show the fallback—your Loading component. Then, when the data loads, React hides the Loading fallback and renders the Albums component with data.\n\nArtistPage.js\nAlbums.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport Albums from './Albums.js';\n\nexport default function ArtistPage({ artist }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n        <Albums artistId={artist.id} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Loading() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nOnly Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a cached Promise with use\n\nSuspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.\n\nThe exact way you would load data in the Albums component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.\n\nSuspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.\n\nRevealing content together at once \n\nBy default, the whole tree inside Suspense is treated as a single unit. For example, even if only one of these components suspends waiting for some data, all of them together will be replaced by the loading indicator:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <Biography />\n\n  <Panel>\n\n    <Albums />\n\n  </Panel>\n\n</Suspense>\n\nThen, after all of them are ready to be displayed, they will all appear together at once.\n\nIn the example below, both Biography and Albums fetch some data. However, because they are grouped under a single Suspense boundary, these components always “pop in” together at the same time.\n\nArtistPage.js\nPanel.js\nBiography.js\nAlbums.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport Albums from './Albums.js';\nimport Biography from './Biography.js';\nimport Panel from './Panel.js';\n\nexport default function ArtistPage({ artist }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n        <Biography artistId={artist.id} />\n        <Panel>\n          <Albums artistId={artist.id} />\n        </Panel>\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Loading() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nComponents that load data don’t have to be direct children of the Suspense boundary. For example, you can move Biography and Albums into a new Details component. This doesn’t change the behavior. Biography and Albums share the same closest parent Suspense boundary, so their reveal is coordinated together.\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <Details artistId={artist.id} />\n\n</Suspense>\n\n\n\nfunction Details({ artistId }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <Biography artistId={artistId} />\n\n      <Panel>\n\n        <Albums artistId={artistId} />\n\n      </Panel>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nRevealing nested content as it loads \n\nWhen a component suspends, the closest parent Suspense component shows the fallback. This lets you nest multiple Suspense components to create a loading sequence. Each Suspense boundary’s fallback will be filled in as the next level of content becomes available. For example, you can give the album list its own fallback:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n\n  <Biography />\n\n  <Suspense fallback={<AlbumsGlimmer />}>\n\n    <Panel>\n\n      <Albums />\n\n    </Panel>\n\n  </Suspense>\n\n</Suspense>\n\nWith this change, displaying the Biography doesn’t need to “wait” for the Albums to load.\n\nThe sequence will be:\n\nIf Biography hasn’t loaded yet, BigSpinner is shown in place of the entire content area.\nOnce Biography finishes loading, BigSpinner is replaced by the content.\nIf Albums hasn’t loaded yet, AlbumsGlimmer is shown in place of Albums and its parent Panel.\nFinally, once Albums finishes loading, it replaces AlbumsGlimmer.\nArtistPage.js\nPanel.js\nBiography.js\nAlbums.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport Albums from './Albums.js';\nimport Biography from './Biography.js';\nimport Panel from './Panel.js';\n\nexport default function ArtistPage({ artist }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>\n      <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n        <Biography artistId={artist.id} />\n        <Suspense fallback={<AlbumsGlimmer />}>\n          <Panel>\n            <Albums artistId={artist.id} />\n          </Panel>\n        </Suspense>\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\nfunction AlbumsGlimmer() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"glimmer-panel\">\n      <div className=\"glimmer-line\" />\n      <div className=\"glimmer-line\" />\n      <div className=\"glimmer-line\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nSuspense boundaries let you coordinate which parts of your UI should always “pop in” together at the same time, and which parts should progressively reveal more content in a sequence of loading states. You can add, move, or delete Suspense boundaries in any place in the tree without affecting the rest of your app’s behavior.\n\nDon’t put a Suspense boundary around every component. Suspense boundaries should not be more granular than the loading sequence that you want the user to experience. If you work with a designer, ask them where the loading states should be placed—it’s likely that they’ve already included them in their design wireframes.\n\nShowing stale content while fresh content is loading \n\nIn this example, the SearchResults component suspends while fetching the search results. Type \"a\", wait for the results, and then edit it to \"ab\". The results for \"a\" will get replaced by the loading fallback.\n\nApp.js\nSearchResults.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <SearchResults query={query} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nA common alternative UI pattern is to defer updating the list and to keep showing the previous results until the new results are ready. The useDeferredValue Hook lets you pass a deferred version of the query down:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <label>\n\n        Search albums:\n\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n\n      </label>\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n\n        <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe query will update immediately, so the input will display the new value. However, the deferredQuery will keep its previous value until the data has loaded, so SearchResults will show the stale results for a bit.\n\nTo make it more obvious to the user, you can add a visual indication when the stale result list is displayed:\n\n<div style={{\n\n  opacity: query !== deferredQuery ? 0.5 : 1 \n\n}}>\n\n  <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n\n</div>\n\nEnter \"a\" in the example below, wait for the results to load, and then edit the input to \"ab\". Notice how instead of the Suspense fallback, you now see the dimmed stale result list until the new results have loaded:\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';\nimport SearchResults from './SearchResults.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');\n  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);\n  const isStale = query !== deferredQuery;\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Search albums:\n        <input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>\n        <div style={{ opacity: isStale ? 0.5 : 1 }}>\n          <SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />\n        </div>\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nBoth deferred values and Transitions let you avoid showing Suspense fallback in favor of inline indicators. Transitions mark the whole update as non-urgent so they are typically used by frameworks and router libraries for navigation. Deferred values, on the other hand, are mostly useful in application code where you want to mark a part of UI as non-urgent and let it “lag behind” the rest of the UI.\n\nPreventing already revealed content from hiding \n\nWhen a component suspends, the closest parent Suspense boundary switches to showing the fallback. This can lead to a jarring user experience if it was already displaying some content. Try pressing this button:\n\nApp.js\nLayout.js\nIndexPage.js\nArtistPage.js\nAlbums.js\nBiography.js\nPanel.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState } from 'react';\nimport IndexPage from './IndexPage.js';\nimport ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js';\nimport Layout from './Layout.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n      <Router />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Router() {\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n    setPage(url);\n  }\n\n  let content;\n  if (page === '/') {\n    content = (\n      <IndexPage navigate={navigate} />\n    );\n  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {\n    content = (\n      <ArtistPage\n        artist={{\n          id: 'the-beatles',\n          name: 'The Beatles',\n        }}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      {content}\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen you pressed the button, the Router component rendered ArtistPage instead of IndexPage. A component inside ArtistPage suspended, so the closest Suspense boundary started showing the fallback. The closest Suspense boundary was near the root, so the whole site layout got replaced by BigSpinner.\n\nTo prevent this, you can mark the navigation state update as a Transition with startTransition:\n\nfunction Router() {\n\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n\n\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n\n    startTransition(() => {\n\n      setPage(url);      \n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\nThis tells React that the state transition is not urgent, and it’s better to keep showing the previous page instead of hiding any already revealed content. Now clicking the button “waits” for the Biography to load:\n\nApp.js\nLayout.js\nIndexPage.js\nArtistPage.js\nAlbums.js\nBiography.js\nPanel.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, startTransition, useState } from 'react';\nimport IndexPage from './IndexPage.js';\nimport ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js';\nimport Layout from './Layout.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n      <Router />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Router() {\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setPage(url);\n    });\n  }\n\n  let content;\n  if (page === '/') {\n    content = (\n      <IndexPage navigate={navigate} />\n    );\n  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {\n    content = (\n      <ArtistPage\n        artist={{\n          id: 'the-beatles',\n          name: 'The Beatles',\n        }}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      {content}\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nA Transition doesn’t wait for all content to load. It only waits long enough to avoid hiding already revealed content. For example, the website Layout was already revealed, so it would be bad to hide it behind a loading spinner. However, the nested Suspense boundary around Albums is new, so the Transition doesn’t wait for it.\n\nNote\n\nSuspense-enabled routers are expected to wrap the navigation updates into Transitions by default.\n\nIndicating that a Transition is happening \n\nIn the above example, once you click the button, there is no visual indication that a navigation is in progress. To add an indicator, you can replace startTransition with useTransition which gives you a boolean isPending value. In the example below, it’s used to change the website header styling while a Transition is happening:\n\nApp.js\nLayout.js\nIndexPage.js\nArtistPage.js\nAlbums.js\nBiography.js\nPanel.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Suspense, useState, useTransition } from 'react';\nimport IndexPage from './IndexPage.js';\nimport ArtistPage from './ArtistPage.js';\nimport Layout from './Layout.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<BigSpinner />}>\n      <Router />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Router() {\n  const [page, setPage] = useState('/');\n  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();\n\n  function navigate(url) {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setPage(url);\n    });\n  }\n\n  let content;\n  if (page === '/') {\n    content = (\n      <IndexPage navigate={navigate} />\n    );\n  } else if (page === '/the-beatles') {\n    content = (\n      <ArtistPage\n        artist={{\n          id: 'the-beatles',\n          name: 'The Beatles',\n        }}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n  return (\n    <Layout isPending={isPending}>\n      {content}\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction BigSpinner() {\n  return <h2>🌀 Loading...</h2>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nResetting Suspense boundaries on navigation \n\nDuring a Transition, React will avoid hiding already revealed content. However, if you navigate to a route with different parameters, you might want to tell React it is different content. You can express this with a key:\n\n<ProfilePage key={queryParams.id} />\n\nImagine you’re navigating within a user’s profile page, and something suspends. If that update is wrapped in a Transition, it will not trigger the fallback for already visible content. That’s the expected behavior.\n\nHowever, now imagine you’re navigating between two different user profiles. In that case, it makes sense to show the fallback. For example, one user’s timeline is different content from another user’s timeline. By specifying a key, you ensure that React treats different users’ profiles as different components, and resets the Suspense boundaries during navigation. Suspense-integrated routers should do this automatically.\n\nProviding a fallback for server errors and client-only content \n\nIf you use one of the streaming server rendering APIs (or a framework that relies on them), React will also use your <Suspense> boundaries to handle errors on the server. If a component throws an error on the server, React will not abort the server render. Instead, it will find the closest <Suspense> component above it and include its fallback (such as a spinner) into the generated server HTML. The user will see a spinner at first.\n\nOn the client, React will attempt to render the same component again. If it errors on the client too, React will throw the error and display the closest Error Boundary. However, if it does not error on the client, React will not display the error to the user since the content was eventually displayed successfully.\n\nYou can use this to opt out some components from rendering on the server. To do this, throw an error in the server environment and then wrap them in a <Suspense> boundary to replace their HTML with fallbacks:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <Chat />\n\n</Suspense>\n\n\n\nfunction Chat() {\n\n  if (typeof window === 'undefined') {\n\n    throw Error('Chat should only render on the client.');\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThe server HTML will include the loading indicator. It will be replaced by the Chat component on the client.\n\nTroubleshooting \nHow do I prevent the UI from being replaced by a fallback during an update? \n\nReplacing visible UI with a fallback creates a jarring user experience. This can happen when an update causes a component to suspend, and the nearest Suspense boundary is already showing content to the user.\n\nTo prevent this from happening, mark the update as non-urgent using startTransition. During a Transition, React will wait until enough data has loaded to prevent an unwanted fallback from appearing:\n\nfunction handleNextPageClick() {\n\n  // If this update suspends, don't hide the already displayed content\n\n  startTransition(() => {\n\n    setCurrentPage(currentPage + 1);\n\n  });\n\n}\n\nThis will avoid hiding existing content. However, any newly rendered Suspense boundaries will still immediately display fallbacks to avoid blocking the UI and let the user see the content as it becomes available.\n\nReact will only prevent unwanted fallbacks during non-urgent updates. It will not delay a render if it’s the result of an urgent update. You must opt in with an API like startTransition or useDeferredValue.\n\nIf your router is integrated with Suspense, it should wrap its updates into startTransition automatically.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<StrictMode>\nNEXT\n<Activity>"

    "title": "<Activity> – React",
    "url": "https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity",
    "html": "API REFERENCE\nCOMPONENTS\n<Activity>\n\n<Activity> lets you hide and restore the UI and internal state of its children.\n\n<Activity mode={visibility}>\n\n  <Sidebar />\n\n</Activity>\nReference\n<Activity>\nUsage\nRestoring the state of hidden components\nRestoring the DOM of hidden components\nPre-rendering content that’s likely to become visible\nSpeeding up interactions during page load\nTroubleshooting\nMy hidden components have unwanted side effects\nMy hidden components have Effects that aren’t running\nReference \n<Activity> \n\nYou can use Activity to hide part of your application:\n\n<Activity mode={isShowingSidebar ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}>\n\n  <Sidebar />\n\n</Activity>\n\nWhen an Activity boundary is hidden, React will visually hide its children using the display: \"none\" CSS property. It will also destroy their Effects, cleaning up any active subscriptions.\n\nWhile hidden, children still re-render in response to new props, albeit at a lower priority than the rest of the content.\n\nWhen the boundary becomes visible again, React will reveal the children with their previous state restored, and re-create their Effects.\n\nIn this way, Activity can be thought of as a mechanism for rendering “background activity”. Rather than completely discarding content that’s likely to become visible again, you can use Activity to maintain and restore that content’s UI and internal state, while ensuring that your hidden content has no unwanted side effects.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nProps \nchildren: The UI you intend to show and hide.\nmode: A string value of either 'visible' or 'hidden'. If omitted, defaults to 'visible'.\nCaveats \nIf an Activity is rendered inside of a ViewTransition, and it becomes visible as a result of an update caused by startTransition, it will activate the ViewTransition’s enter animation. If it becomes hidden, it will activate its exit animation.\nAn Activity that just renders text will not render anything rather than rendering hidden text, because there’s no corresponding DOM element to apply visibility changes to. For example, <Activity mode=\"hidden\"><ComponentThatJustReturnsText /></Activity> will not produce any output in the DOM for const ComponentThatJustReturnsText = () => \"Hello, World!\".\nUsage \nRestoring the state of hidden components \n\nIn React, when you want to conditionally show or hide a component, you typically mount or unmount it based on that condition:\n\n{isShowingSidebar && (\n\n  <Sidebar />\n\n)}\n\nBut unmounting a component destroys its internal state, which is not always what you want.\n\nWhen you hide a component using an Activity boundary instead, React will “save” its state for later:\n\n<Activity mode={isShowingSidebar ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}>\n\n  <Sidebar />\n\n</Activity>\n\nThis makes it possible to hide and then later restore components in the state they were previously in.\n\nThe following example has a sidebar with an expandable section. You can press “Overview” to reveal the three subitems below it. The main app area also has a button that hides and shows the sidebar.\n\nTry expanding the Overview section, and then toggling the sidebar closed then open:\n\nApp.js\nSidebar.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport Sidebar from './Sidebar.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isShowingSidebar, setIsShowingSidebar] = useState(true);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {isShowingSidebar && (\n        <Sidebar />\n      )}\n\n      <main>\n        <button onClick={() => setIsShowingSidebar(!isShowingSidebar)}>\n          Toggle sidebar\n        </button>\n        <h1>Main content</h1>\n      </main>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe Overview section always starts out collapsed. Because we unmount the sidebar when isShowingSidebar flips to false, all its internal state is lost.\n\nThis is a perfect use case for Activity. We can preserve the internal state of our sidebar, even when visually hiding it.\n\nLet’s replace the conditional rendering of our sidebar with an Activity boundary:\n\n// Before\n\n{isShowingSidebar && (\n\n  <Sidebar />\n\n)}\n\n\n\n// After\n\n<Activity mode={isShowingSidebar ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>\n\n  <Sidebar />\n\n</Activity>\n\nand check out the new behavior:\n\nApp.js\nSidebar.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Activity, useState } from 'react';\n\nimport Sidebar from './Sidebar.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isShowingSidebar, setIsShowingSidebar] = useState(true);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Activity mode={isShowingSidebar ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>\n        <Sidebar />\n      </Activity>\n\n      <main>\n        <button onClick={() => setIsShowingSidebar(!isShowingSidebar)}>\n          Toggle sidebar\n        </button>\n        <h1>Main content</h1>\n      </main>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nOur sidebar’s internal state is now restored, without any changes to its implementation.\n\nRestoring the DOM of hidden components \n\nSince Activity boundaries hide their children using display: none, their children’s DOM is also preserved when hidden. This makes them great for maintaining ephemeral state in parts of the UI that the user is likely to interact with again.\n\nIn this example, the Contact tab has a <textarea> where the user can enter a message. If you enter some text, change to the Home tab, then change back to the Contact tab, the draft message is lost:\n\nApp.js\nTabButton.js\nHome.js\nContact.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nexport default function Contact() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Send me a message!</p>\n\n      <textarea />\n\n      <p>You can find me online here:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>admin@mysite.com</li>\n        <li>+123456789</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThis is because we’re fully unmounting Contact in App. When the Contact tab unmounts, the <textarea> element’s internal DOM state is lost.\n\nIf we switch to using an Activity boundary to show and hide the active tab, we can preserve the state of each tab’s DOM.

If you press it, you’ll see a Suspense fallback displayed while the data is being fetched:\n\nApp.js\nHome.js\nPosts.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, Suspense } from 'react';\nimport TabButton from './TabButton.js';\nimport Home from './Home.js';\nimport Posts from './Posts.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('home');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'home'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}\n      >\n        Home\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'posts'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('posts')}\n      >\n        Posts\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<h1>🌀 Loading...</h1>}>\n        {activeTab === 'home' && <Home />}\n        {activeTab === 'posts' && <Posts />}\n      </Suspense>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis is because App doesn’t mount Posts until its tab is active.\n\nIf we update App to use an Activity boundary to show and hide the active tab, Posts will be pre-rendered when the app first loads, allowing it to fetch its data before it becomes visible.\n\nTry clicking the Posts tab now:\n\nApp.js\nHome.js\nPosts.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Activity, useState, Suspense } from 'react';\nimport TabButton from './TabButton.js';\nimport Home from './Home.js';\nimport Posts from './Posts.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('home');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'home'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}\n      >\n        Home\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'posts'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('posts')}\n      >\n        Posts\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<h1>🌀 Loading...</h1>}>\n        <Activity mode={activeTab === 'home' ?

They include:\n\nData fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js\nLazy-loading component code with lazy\nReading the value of a cached Promise with use\n\nActivity does not detect data that is fetched inside an Effect.\n\nThe exact way you would load data in the Posts component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.\n\nSuspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.\n\nSpeeding up interactions during page load \n\nReact includes an under-the-hood performance optimization called Selective Hydration. It works by hydrating your app’s initial HTML in chunks, enabling some components to become interactive even if other components on the page haven’t loaded their code or data yet.\n\nSuspense boundaries participate in Selective Hydration, because they naturally divide your component tree into units that are independent from one another:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MessageComposer />\n\n\n\n      <Suspense fallback=\"Loading chats...\">\n\n        <Chats />\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </>\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nHere, MessageComposer can be fully hydrated during the initial render of the page, even before Chats is mounted and starts to fetch its data.\n\nSo by breaking up your component tree into discrete units, Suspense allows React to hydrate your app’s server-rendered HTML in chunks, enabling parts of your app to become interactive as fast as possible.\n\nBut what about pages that don’t use Suspense?\n\nTake this tabs example:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('home');\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <TabButton onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}>\n\n        Home\n\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <TabButton onClick={() => setActiveTab('video')}>\n\n        Video\n\n      </TabButton>\n\n\n\n      {activeTab === 'home' && (\n\n        <Home />\n\n      )}\n\n      {activeTab === 'video' && (\n\n        <Video />\n\n      )}\n\n    </>\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nHere, React must hydrate the entire page all at once. If Home or Video are slower to render, they could make the tab buttons feel unresponsive during hydration.\n\nAdding Suspense around the active tab would solve this:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('home');\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <TabButton onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}>\n\n        Home\n\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <TabButton onClick={() => setActiveTab('video')}>\n\n        Video\n\n      </TabButton>\n\n\n\n      <Suspense fallback={<Placeholder />}>\n\n        {activeTab === 'home' && (\n\n          <Home />\n\n        )}\n\n        {activeTab === 'video' && (\n\n          <Video />\n\n        )}\n\n      </Suspense>\n\n    </>\n\n  )\n\n}\n\n…but it would also change the UI, since the Placeholder fallback would be displayed on the initial render.\n\nInstead, we can use Activity. Since Activity boundaries show and hide their children, they already naturally divide the component tree into independent units. And just like Suspense, this feature allows them to participate in Selective Hydration.\n\nLet’s update our example to use Activity boundaries around the active tab:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('home');\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <TabButton onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}>\n\n        Home\n\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <TabButton onClick={() => setActiveTab('video')}>\n\n        Video\n\n      </TabButton>\n\n\n\n      <Activity mode={activeTab === \"home\" ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}>\n\n        <Home />\n\n      </Activity>\n\n      <Activity mode={activeTab === \"video\" ? \"visible\" : \"hidden\"}>\n\n        <Video />\n\n      </Activity>\n\n    </>\n\n  )\n\n}\n\nNow our initial server-rendered HTML looks the same as it did in the original version, but thanks to Activity, React can hydrate the tab buttons first, before it even mounts Home or Video.\n\nThus, in addition to hiding and showing content, Activity boundaries help improve your app’s performance during hydration by letting React know which parts of your page can become interactive in isolation.\n\nAnd even if your page doesn’t ever hide part of its content, you can still add always-visible Activity boundaries to improve hydration performance:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <Post />\n\n\n\n      <Activity>\n\n        <Comments />\n\n      </Activity>\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nTroubleshooting \nMy hidden components have unwanted side effects \n\nAn Activity boundary hides its content by setting display: none on its children and cleaning up any of their Effects. So, most well-behaved React components that properly clean up their side effects will already be robust to being hidden by Activity.\n\nBut there are some situations where a hidden component behaves differently than an unmounted one. Most notably, since a hidden component’s DOM is not destroyed, any side effects from that DOM will persist, even after the component is hidden.\n\nAs an example, consider a <video> tag. Typically it doesn’t require any cleanup, because even if you’re playing a video, unmounting the tag stops the video and audio from playing in the browser. Try playing the video and then pressing Home in this demo:\n\nApp.js\nHome.js\nVideo.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport TabButton from './TabButton.js';\nimport Home from './Home.js';\nimport Video from './Video.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('video');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'home'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}\n      >\n        Home\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'video'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('video')}\n      >\n        Video\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      {activeTab === 'home' && <Home />}\n      {activeTab === 'video' && <Video />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThe video stops playing as expected.\n\nNow, let’s say we wanted to preserve the timecode where the user last watched, so that when they tab back to the video, it doesn’t start over from the beginning again.\n\nThis is a great use case for Activity!\n\nLet’s update App to hide the inactive tab with a hidden Activity boundary instead of unmounting it, and see how the demo behaves this time:\n\nApp.js\nHome.js\nVideo.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Activity, useState } from 'react';\nimport TabButton from './TabButton.js';\nimport Home from './Home.js';\nimport Video from './Video.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('video');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'home'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}\n      >\n        Home\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'video'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('video')}\n      >\n        Video\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'home' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>\n        <Home />\n      </Activity>\n      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'video' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>\n        <Video />\n      </Activity>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhoops! The video and audio continue to play even after it’s been hidden, because the tab’s <video> element is still in the DOM.\n\nTo fix this, we can add an Effect with a cleanup function that pauses the video:\n\nexport default function VideoTab() {\n\n  const ref = useRef();\n\n\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n\n    const videoRef = ref.current;\n\n\n\n    return () => {\n\n      videoRef.pause()\n\n    }\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <video\n\n      ref={ref}\n\n      controls\n\n      playsInline\n\n      src=\"...\"\n\n    />\n\n\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nWe call useLayoutEffect instead of useEffect because conceptually the clean-up code is tied to the component’s UI being visually hidden. If we used a regular effect, the code could be delayed by (say) a re-suspending Suspense boundary or a View Transition.\n\nLet’s see the new behavior. Try playing the video, switching to the Home tab, then back to the Video tab:\n\nApp.js\nHome.js\nVideo.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Activity, useState } from 'react';\nimport TabButton from './TabButton.js';\nimport Home from './Home.js';\nimport Video from './Video.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('video');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'home'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('home')}\n      >\n        Home\n      </TabButton>\n      <TabButton\n        isActive={activeTab === 'video'}\n        onClick={() => setActiveTab('video')}\n      >\n        Video\n      </TabButton>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'home' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>\n        <Home />\n      </Activity>\n      <Activity mode={activeTab === 'video' ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>\n        <Video />\n      </Activity>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIt works great! Our cleanup function ensures that the video stops playing if it’s ever hidden by an Activity boundary, and even better, because the <video> tag is never destroyed, the timecode is preserved, and the video itself doesn’t need to be initialized or downloaded again when the user switches back to keep watching it.\n\nThis is a great example of using Activity to preserve ephemeral DOM state for parts of the UI that become hidden, but the user is likely to interact with again soon.\n\nOur example illustrates that for certain tags like <video>, unmounting and hiding have different behavior. If a component renders DOM that has a side effect, and you want to prevent that side effect when an Activity boundary hides it, add an Effect with a return function to clean it up.\n\nThe most common cases of this will be from the following tags:\n\n<video>\n<audio>\n<iframe>\n\nTypically, though, most of your React components should already be robust to being hidden by an Activity boundary. And conceptually, you should think of “hidden” Activities as being unmounted.\n\nTo eagerly discover other Effects that don’t have proper cleanup, which is important not only for Activity boundaries but for many other behaviors in React, we recommend using <StrictMode>.\n\nMy hidden components have Effects that aren’t running \n\nWhen an <Activity> is “hidden”, all its children’s Effects are cleaned up. Conceptually, the children are unmounted, but React saves their state for later. This is a feature of Activity because it means subscriptions won’t be active for hidden parts of the UI, reducing the amount of work needed for hidden content.\n\nIf you’re relying on an Effect mounting to clean up a component’s side effects, refactor the Effect to do the work in the returned cleanup function instead.\n\nTo eagerly find problematic Effects, we recommend adding <StrictMode> which will eagerly perform Activity unmounts and mounts to catch any unexpected side-effects.\n\nPREVIOUS\n<Suspense>\nNEXT\n<ViewTransition>"

React uses the following heuristics to determine if a View Transition activates for an animation:\n\nenter: If a ViewTransition itself gets inserted in this Transition, then this will activate.\nexit: If a ViewTransition itself gets deleted in this Transition, then this will activate.\nupdate: If a ViewTransition has any DOM mutations inside it that React is doing (such as a prop changing) or if the ViewTransition boundary itself changes size or position due to an immediate sibling. If there are nested ViewTransition then the mutation applies to them and not the parent.\nshare: If a named ViewTransition is inside a deleted subtree and another named ViewTransition with the same name is part of an inserted subtree in the same Transition, they form a Shared Element Transition, and it animates from the deleted one to the inserted one.\n\nBy default, <ViewTransition> animates with a smooth cross-fade (the browser default view transition). You can customize the animation by providing a View Transition Class to the <ViewTransition> component. You can  customize animations for each kind of trigger (see Styling View Transitions).\n\nDEEP DIVE\nHow does <ViewTransition> work? \nShow Details\nProps \n\nBy default, <ViewTransition> animates with a smooth cross-fade. You can customize the animation, or specify a shared element transition, with these props:\n\noptional enter: A string or object. The View Transition Class to apply when enter is activated.\noptional exit: A string or object. The View Transition Class to apply when exit is activated.\noptional update: A string or object. The View Transition Class to apply when an update is activated.\noptional share: A string or object. The View Transition Class to apply when a shared element is activated.\noptional default: A string or object. The View Transition Class used when no other matching activation prop is found.\noptional name: A string or object. The name of the View Transition used for shared element transitions. If not provided, React will use a unique name for each View Transition to prevent unexpected animations.\nCallback \n\nThese callbacks allow you to adjust the animation imperatively using the animate APIs:\n\noptional onEnter: A function. React calls onEnter after an “enter” animation.\noptional onExit: A function. React calls onExit after an “exit” animation.\noptional onShare: A function. React calls onShare after a “share” animation.\noptional onUpdate: A function. React calls onUpdate after an “update” animation.\n\nEach callback receives as arguments:\n\nelement: The DOM element that was animated.\ntypes: The Transition Types included in the animation.\nView Transition Class \n\nThe View Transition Class is the CSS class name(s) applied by React during the transition when the ViewTransition activates. It can be a string or an object.\n\nstring: the class added on the child elements when activated. If 'none' is provided, no class will be added.\nobject: the class added on the child elements will be the key matching View Transition type added with addTransitionType. The object can also specify a default to use if no matching type is found.\n\nThe value 'none' can be used to prevent a View Transition from activating for a specific trigger.\n\nStyling View Transitions \nNote\n\nIn many early examples of View Transitions around the web, you’ll have seen using a view-transition-name and then style it using ::view-transition-...(my-name) selectors. We don’t recommend that for styling. Instead, we normally recommend using a View Transition Class instead.\n\nTo customize the animation for a <ViewTransition> you can provide a View Transition Class to one of the activation props. The View Transition Class is a CSS class name that React applies to the child elements when the ViewTransition activates.\n\nFor example, to customize an “enter” animation, provide a class name to the enter prop:\n\n<ViewTransition enter=\"slide-in\">\n\nWhen the <ViewTransition> activates an “enter” animation, React will add the class name slide-in. Then you can refer to this class using view transition pseudo selectors to build reusable animations:\n\n::view-transition-group(.slide-in) {\n\n  \n\n}\n\n::view-transition-old(.slide-in) {\n\n\n\n}\n\n::view-transition-new(.slide-in) {\n\n\n\n}\n\nIn the future, CSS libraries may add built-in animations using View Transition Classes to make this easier to use.\n\nCaveats \nBy default, setState updates immediately and does not activate <ViewTransition>, only updates wrapped in a Transition. You can also use <Suspense> to opt-in to a Transition to reveal content.\n<ViewTransition> creates an image that can be moved around, scaled and cross-faded. Unlike Layout Animations you may have seen in React Native or Motion, this means that not every individual Element inside of it animates its position. This can lead to better performance and a more continuous feeling, smooth animation compared to animating every individual piece. However, it can also lose continuity in things that should be moving by themselves. So you might have to add more <ViewTransition> boundaries manually as a result.\nMany users may prefer not having animations on the page. React doesn’t automatically disable animations for this case. We recommend that using the @media (prefers-reduced-motion) media query to disable animations or tone them down based on user preference. In the future, CSS libraries may have this built-in to their presets.\nCurrently, <ViewTransition> only works in the DOM. We’re working on adding support for React Native and other platforms.\nUsage \nAnimating an element on enter/exit \n\nEnter/Exit Transitions trigger when a <ViewTransition> is added or removed by a component in a transition:\n\nfunction Child() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ViewTransition>\n\n      <div>Hi</div>\n\n    </ViewTransition>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Parent() {\n\n  const [show, setShow] = useState();\n\n  if (show) {\n\n    return <Child />;\n\n  }\n\n  return null;\n\n}\n\nWhen setShow is called, show switches to true and the Child component is rendered. When setShow is called inside startTransition, and Child renders a ViewTransition before any other DOM nodes, an enter animation is triggered.\n\nWhen show switches back to false, an exit animation is triggered.\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition\n} from 'react';\nimport {Video} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\"\n\nfunction Item() {\n  return (\n    <ViewTransition>\n      <Video video={videos[0]}/>\n    </ViewTransition>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [showItem, setShowItem] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          startTransition(() => {\n            setShowItem((prev) => !prev);\n          });\n        }}\n      >{showItem ? '➖' : '➕'}</button>\n\n      {showItem ? <Item /> : null}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\n<ViewTransition> only activates if it is placed before any DOM node. If Child instead looked like this, no animation would trigger:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return <ViewTransition>Hi</ViewTransition>;\n\n}\nAnimating a shared element \n\nNormally, we don’t recommend assigning a name to a <ViewTransition> and instead let React assign it an automatic name. The reason you might want to assign a name is to animate between completely different components when one tree unmounts and another tree mounts at the same time. To preserve continuity.\n\n<ViewTransition name={UNIQUE_NAME}>\n\n  <Child />\n\n</ViewTransition>\n\nWhen one tree unmounts and another mounts, if there’s a pair where the same name exists in the unmounting tree and the mounting tree, they trigger the “share” animation on both. It animates from the unmounting side to the mounting side.\n\nUnlike an exit/enter animation this can be deeply inside the deleted/mounted tree. If a <ViewTransition> would also be eligible for exit/enter, then the “share” animation takes precedence.\n\nIf Transition first unmounts one side and then leads to a <Suspense> fallback being shown before eventually the new name being mounted, then no shared element transition happens.\n\nApp.js\nVideo.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition\n} from \"react\";\nimport {Video, Thumbnail, FullscreenVideo} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\";\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [fullscreen, setFullscreen] = useState(false);\n  if (fullscreen) {\n    return <FullscreenVideo\n      video={videos[0]}\n      onExit={() => startTransition(() => setFullscreen(false))}\n    />\n  }\n  return <Video\n    video={videos[0]}\n    onClick={() => startTransition(() => setFullscreen(true))}\n  />\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nIf either the mounted or unmounted side of a pair is outside the viewport, then no pair is formed. This ensures that it doesn’t fly in or out of the viewport when something is scrolled. Instead it’s treated as a regular enter/exit by itself.\n\nThis does not happen if the same Component instance changes position, which triggers an “update”. Those animate regardless if one position is outside the viewport.\n\nThere’s currently a quirk where if a deeply nested unmounted <ViewTransition> is inside the viewport but the mounted side is not within the viewport, then the unmounted side animates as its own “exit” animation even if it’s deeply nested instead of as part of the parent animation.\n\nPitfall\n\nIt’s important that there’s only one thing with the same name mounted at a time in the entire app. Therefore it’s important to use unique namespaces for the name to avoid conflicts. To ensure you can do this you might want to add a constant in a separate module that you import.\n\nexport const MY_NAME = \"my-globally-unique-name\";\n\nimport {MY_NAME} from './shared-name';\n\n...\n\n<ViewTransition name={MY_NAME}>\nAnimating reorder of items in a list \nitems.map(item => <Component key={item.id} item={item} />)\n\nWhen reordering a list, without updating the content, the “update” animation triggers on each <ViewTransition> in the list if they’re outside a DOM node. Similar to enter/exit animations.\n\nThis means that this will trigger the animation on this <ViewTransition>:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return <ViewTransition><div>...</div></ViewTransition>;\n\n}\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition\n} from \"react\";\nimport {Video} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\";\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [orderedVideos, setOrderedVideos] = useState(videos);\n  const reorder = () => {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setOrderedVideos((prev) => {\n        return [...prev.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)];\n      });\n    });\n  };\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={reorder}>🎲</button>\n      <div className=\"listContainer\">\n        {orderedVideos.map((video, i) => {\n          return (\n            <ViewTransition key={video.title}>\n              <Video video={video} />\n            </ViewTransition>\n          );\n        })}\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nHowever, this wouldn’t animate each individual item:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return <div><ViewTransition>...</ViewTransition></div>;\n\n}\n\nInstead, any parent <ViewTransition> would cross-fade. If there is no parent <ViewTransition> then there’s no animation in that case.\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition\n} from \"react\";\nimport {Video} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\";\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [orderedVideos, setOrderedVideos] = useState(videos);\n  const reorder = () => {\n    startTransition(() => {\n      setOrderedVideos((prev) => {\n        return [...prev.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)];\n      });\n    });\n  };\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={reorder}>🎲</button>\n      <ViewTransition>\n        <div className=\"listContainer\">\n          {orderedVideos.map((video, i) => {\n            return <Video video={video} key={video.title} />;\n          })}\n        </div>\n      </ViewTransition>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis means you might want to avoid wrapper elements in lists where you want to allow the Component to control its own reorder animation:\n\nitems.map(item => <div><Component key={item.id} item={item} /></div>)\n\nThe above rule also applies if one of the items updates to resize, which then causes the siblings to resize, it’ll also animate its sibling <ViewTransition> but only if they’re immediate siblings.\n\nThis means that during an update, which causes a lot of re-layout, it doesn’t individually animate every <ViewTransition> on the page. That would lead to a lot of noisy animations which distracts from the actual change. Therefore React is more conservative about when an individual animation triggers.\n\nPitfall\n\nIt’s important to properly use keys to preserve identity when reordering lists. It might seem like you could use “name”, shared element transitions, to animate reorders but that would not trigger if one side was outside the viewport. To animate a reorder you often want to show that it went to a position outside the viewport.\n\nAnimating from Suspense content \n\nJust like any Transition, React waits for data and new CSS (<link rel=\"stylesheet\" precedence=\"...\">) before running the animation. In addition to this, ViewTransitions also wait up to 500ms for new fonts to load before starting the animation to avoid them flickering in later. For the same reason, an image wrapped in ViewTransition will wait for the image to load.\n\nIf it’s inside a new Suspense boundary instance, then the fallback is shown first. After the Suspense boundary fully loads, it triggers the <ViewTransition> to animate the reveal to the content.\n\nCurrently, this only happens for client-side Transition. In the future, this will also animate Suspense boundary for streaming SSR when content from the server suspends during the initial load.\n\nThere are two ways to animate Suspense boundaries depending on where you place the <ViewTransition>:\n\nUpdate:\n\n<ViewTransition>\n\n  <Suspense fallback={<A />}>\n\n    <B />\n\n  </Suspense>\n\n</ViewTransition>\n\nIn this scenario when the content goes from A to B, it’ll be treated as an “update” and apply that class if appropriate. Both A and B will get the same view-transition-name and therefore they’re acting as a cross-fade by default.\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition,\n  Suspense\n} from 'react';\nimport {Video, VideoPlaceholder} from \"./Video\";\nimport {useLazyVideoData} from \"./data\"\n\nfunction LazyVideo() {\n  const video = useLazyVideoData();\n  return (\n    <Video video={video}/>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [showItem, setShowItem] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          startTransition(() => {\n            setShowItem((prev) => !prev);\n          });\n        }}\n      >{showItem ?

This will be treated as an “exit” of the <A> and an “enter” of the <B>.\n\nYou can achieve different effects depending on where you choose to place the <ViewTransition> boundary.\n\nOpting-out of an animation \n\nSometimes you’re wrapping a large existing component, like a whole page, and you want to animate some updates, such as changing the theme. However, you don’t want it to opt-in all updates inside the whole page to cross-fade when they’re updating. Especially if you’re incrementally adding more animations.\n\nYou can use the class “none” to opt-out of an animation. By wrapping your children in a “none” you can disable animations for updates to them while the parent still triggers.\n\n<ViewTransition>\n\n  <div className={theme}>\n\n    <ViewTransition update=\"none\">\n\n      {children}\n\n    </ViewTransition>\n\n  </div>\n\n</ViewTransition>\n\nThis will only animate if the theme changes and not if only the children update. The children can still opt-in again with their own <ViewTransition> but at least it’s manual again.\n\nCustomizing animations \n\nBy default, <ViewTransition> includes the default cross-fade from the browser.\n\nTo customize animations, you can provide props to the <ViewTransition> component to specify which animations to use, based on how the <ViewTransition> activates.\n\nFor example, we can slow down the default cross fade animation:\n\n<ViewTransition default=\"slow-fade\">\n\n  <Video />\n\n</ViewTransition>\n\nAnd define slow-fade in CSS using view transition classes:\n\n::view-transition-old(.slow-fade) {\n\n    animation-duration: 500ms;\n\n}\n\n\n\n::view-transition-new(.slow-fade) {\n\n    animation-duration: 500ms;\n\n}\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition\n} from 'react';\nimport {Video} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\"\n\nfunction Item() {\n  return (\n    <ViewTransition default=\"slow-fade\">\n      <Video video={videos[0]}/>\n    </ViewTransition>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [showItem, setShowItem] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          startTransition(() => {\n            setShowItem((prev) => !prev);\n          });\n        }}\n      >{showItem ? '➖' : '➕'}</button>\n\n      {showItem ? <Item /> : null}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIn addition to setting the default, you can also provide configurations for enter, exit, update, and share animations.\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  useState,\n  startTransition\n} from 'react';\nimport {Video} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\"\n\nfunction Item() {\n  return (\n    <ViewTransition enter=\"slide-in\" exit=\"slide-out\">\n      <Video video={videos[0]}/>\n    </ViewTransition>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [showItem, setShowItem] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => {\n          startTransition(() => {\n            setShowItem((prev) => !prev);\n          });\n        }}\n      >{showItem ? '➖' : '➕'}</button>\n\n      {showItem ? <Item /> : null}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nCustomizing animations with types \n\nYou can use the addTransitionType API to add a class name to the child elements when a specific transition type is activated for a specific activation trigger. This allows you to customize the animation for each type of transition.\n\nFor example, to customize the animation for all forward and backward navigations:\n\n<ViewTransition default={{\n\n  'navigation-back': 'slide-right',\n\n  'navigation-forward': 'slide-left',\n\n }}>\n\n  <div>...</div>\n\n</ViewTransition>\n\n \n\n// in your router:\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  addTransitionType('navigation-' + navigationType);\n\n});\n\nWhen the ViewTransition activates a “navigation-back” animation, React will add the class name “slide-right”. When the ViewTransition activates a “navigation-forward” animation, React will add the class name “slide-left”.\n\nIn the future, routers and other libraries may add support for standard view-transition types and styles.\n\nApp.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport {\n  ViewTransition,\n  addTransitionType,\n  useState,\n  startTransition,\n} from \"react\";\nimport {Video} from \"./Video\";\nimport videos from \"./data\"\n\nfunction Item() {\n  return (\n    <ViewTransition enter={\n        {\n          \"add-video-back\": \"slide-in-back\",\n          \"add-video-forward\": \"slide-in-forward\"\n        }\n      }\n      exit={\n        {\n          \"remove-video-back\": \"slide-in-forward\",\n          \"remove-video-forward\": \"slide-in-back\"\n        }\n      }>\n      <Video video={videos[0]}/>\n    </ViewTransition>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Component() {\n  const [showItem, setShowItem] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"button-container\">\n        <button\n          onClick={() => {\n            startTransition(() => {\n              if (showItem) {\n                addTransitionType(\"remove-video-back\")\n              } else {\n                addTransitionType(\"add-video-back\")\n              }\n              setShowItem((prev) => !prev);\n            });\n          }}\n        >⬅️</button>\n        <button\n          onClick={() => {\n            startTransition(() => {\n              if (showItem) {\n                addTransitionType(\"remove-video-forward\")\n              } else {\n                addTransitionType(\"add-video-forward\")\n              }\n              setShowItem((prev) => !prev);\n            });\n          }}\n        >➡️</button>\n      </div>\n      {showItem ? <Item /> : null}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nBuilding View Transition enabled routers \n\nReact waits for any pending Navigation to finish to ensure that scroll restoration happens within the animation. If the Navigation is blocked on React, your router must unblock in useLayoutEffect since useEffect would lead to a deadlock.\n\nIf a startTransition is started from the legacy popstate event, such as during a “back”-navigation then it must finish synchronously to ensure scroll and form restoration works correctly. This is in conflict with running a View Transition animation. Therefore, React will skip animations from popstate. Therefore animations won’t run for the back button. You can fix this by upgrading your router to use the Navigation API.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy <ViewTransition> is not activating \n\n<ViewTransition> only activates if it is placed before any DOM node:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <div>\n\n      <ViewTransition>Hi</ViewTransition>\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nTo fix, ensure that the <ViewTransition> comes before any other DOM nodes:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ViewTransition>\n\n      <div>Hi</div>\n\n    </ViewTransition>\n\n  );\n\n}\nI’m getting an error “There are two <ViewTransition name=%s> components with the same name mounted at the same time.” \n\nThis error occurs when two <ViewTransition> components with the same name are mounted at the same time:\n\nfunction Item() {\n\n  // 🚩 All items will get the same \"name\".\n\n  return <ViewTransition name=\"item\">...</ViewTransition>;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction ItemList({items}) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      {item.map(item => <Item key={item.id} />)}\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis will cause the View Transition to error. In development, React detects this issue to surface it and logs two errors:\n\nConsole\nThere are two <ViewTransition name=%s> components with the same name mounted at the same time. This is not supported and will cause View Transitions to error. Try to use a more unique name e.g. by using a namespace prefix and adding the id of an item to the name.\n    at Item\n    at ItemList\nThe existing <ViewTransition name=%s> duplicate has this stack trace.\n    at Item\n    at ItemList\n\nTo fix, ensure that there’s only one <ViewTransition> with the same name mounted at a time in the entire app by ensuring the name is unique, or adding an id to the name:\n\nfunction Item({id}) {\n\n  // ✅ All items will get the same \"name\".\n\n  return <ViewTransition name={`item-${id}`}>...</ViewTransition>;\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction ItemList({items}) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      {item.map(item => <Item key={item.id} item={item} />)}\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\n<Activity>\nNEXT\nAPIs"

    "html": "API REFERENCE\nAPIS\nact\n\nact is a test helper to apply pending React updates before making assertions.\n\nawait act(async actFn)\n\nTo prepare a component for assertions, wrap the code rendering it and performing updates inside an await act() call. This makes your test run closer to how React works in the browser.\n\nNote\n\nYou might find using act() directly a bit too verbose. To avoid some of the boilerplate, you could use a library like React Testing Library, whose helpers are wrapped with act().\n\nReference\nawait act(async actFn)\nUsage\nRendering components in tests\nDispatching events in tests\nTroubleshooting\nI’m getting an error: “The current testing environment is not configured to support act”(…)”\nReference \nawait act(async actFn) \n\nWhen writing UI tests, tasks like rendering, user events, or data fetching can be considered as “units” of interaction with a user interface. React provides a helper called act() that makes sure all updates related to these “units” have been processed and applied to the DOM before you make any assertions.\n\nThe name act comes from the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.\n\nit ('renders with button disabled', async () => {\n\n  await act(async () => {\n\n    root.render(<TestComponent />)\n\n  });\n\n  expect(container.querySelector('button')).toBeDisabled();\n\n});\nNote\n\nWe recommend using act with await and an async function. Although the sync version works in many cases, it doesn’t work in all cases and due to the way React schedules updates internally, it’s difficult to predict when you can use the sync version.\n\nWe will deprecate and remove the sync version in the future.\n\nParameters \nasync actFn: An async function wrapping renders or interactions for components being tested. Any updates triggered within the actFn, are added to an internal act queue, which are then flushed together to process and apply any changes to the DOM. Since it is async, React will also run any code that crosses an async boundary, and flush any updates scheduled.\nReturns \n\nact does not return anything.\n\nUsage \n\nWhen testing a component, you can use act to make assertions about its output.\n\nFor example, let’s say we have this Counter component, the usage examples below show how to test it:\n\nfunction Counter() {\n\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = () => {\n\n    setCount(prev => prev + 1);\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;\n\n  }, [count]);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <div>\n\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n\n        Click me\n\n      </button>\n\n    </div>\n\n  )\n\n}\nRendering components in tests \n\nTo test the render output of a component, wrap the render inside act():\n\nimport {act} from 'react';\n\nimport ReactDOMClient from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport Counter from './Counter';\n\n\n\nit('can render and update a counter', async () => {\n\n  container = document.createElement('div');\n\n  document.body.appendChild(container);\n\n  \n\n  // ✅ Render the component inside act().\n\n  await act(() => {\n\n    ReactDOMClient.createRoot(container).render(<Counter />);\n\n  });\n\n  \n\n  const button = container.querySelector('button');\n\n  const label = container.querySelector('p');\n\n  expect(label.textContent).toBe('You clicked 0 times');\n\n  expect(document.title).toBe('You clicked 0 times');\n\n});\n\nHere, we create a container, append it to the document, and render the Counter component inside act(). This ensures that the component is rendered and its effects are applied before making assertions.\n\nUsing act ensures that all updates have been applied before we make assertions.\n\nDispatching events in tests \n\nTo test events, wrap the event dispatch inside act():\n\nimport {act} from 'react';\n\nimport ReactDOMClient from 'react-dom/client';\n\nimport Counter from './Counter';\n\n\n\nit.only('can render and update a counter', async () => {\n\n  const container = document.createElement('div');\n\n  document.body.appendChild(container);\n\n  \n\n  await act( async () => {\n\n    ReactDOMClient.createRoot(container).render(<Counter />);\n\n  });\n\n  \n\n  // ✅ Dispatch the event inside act().\n\n  await act(async () => {\n\n    button.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click', { bubbles: true }));\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  const button = container.querySelector('button');\n\n  const label = container.querySelector('p');\n\n  expect(label.textContent).toBe('You clicked 1 times');\n\n  expect(document.title).toBe('You clicked 1 times');\n\n});\n\nHere, we render the component with act, and then dispatch the event inside another act(). This ensures that all updates from the event are applied before making assertions.\n\nPitfall\n\nDon’t forget that dispatching DOM events only works when the DOM container is added to the document. You can use a library like React Testing Library to reduce the boilerplate code.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI’m getting an error: “The current testing environment is not configured to support act”(…)” \n\nUsing act requires setting global.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT=true in your test environment. This is to ensure that act is only used in the correct environment.\n\nIf you don’t set the global, you will see an error like this:\n\nConsole\nWarning: The current testing environment is not configured to support act(…)\n\nTo fix, add this to your global setup file for React tests:\n\nglobal.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT=true\nNote\n\nIn testing frameworks like React Testing Library, IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT is already set for you.\n\nPREVIOUS\nAPIs\nNEXT\naddTransitionType"

This means a <Suspense> fallback will associate the types after a startTransition, but revealing the content does not.\nUsage \nAdding the cause of a transition \n\nCall addTransitionType inside of startTransition to indicate the cause of a transition:\n\nimport { startTransition, addTransitionType } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Submit({action) {\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    startTransition(() => {\n\n      addTransitionType('submit-click');\n\n      action();\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;\n\n}\n\nWhen you call addTransitionType inside the scope of startTransition, React will associate submit-click as one of the causes for the Transition.\n\nCurrently, Transition Types can be used to customize different animations based on what caused the Transition. You have three different ways to choose from for how to use them:\n\nCustomize animations using browser view transition types\nCustomize animations using View Transition Class\nCustomize animations using ViewTransition events\n\nIn the future, we plan to support more use cases for using the cause of a transition.\n\nCustomize animations using browser view transition types \n\nWhen a ViewTransition activates from a transition, React adds all the Transition Types as browser view transition types to the element.\n\nThis allows you to customize different animations based on CSS scopes:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ViewTransition>\n\n      <div>Hello</div>\n\n    </ViewTransition>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  addTransitionType('my-transition-type');\n\n  setShow(true);\n\n});\n:root:active-view-transition-type(my-transition-type) {\n\n  &::view-transition-...(...) {\n\n    ...\n\n  }\n\n}\nCustomize animations using View Transition Class \n\nYou can customize animations for an activated ViewTransition based on type by passing an object to the View Transition Class:\n\nfunction Component() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <ViewTransition enter={{\n\n      'my-transition-type': 'my-transition-class',\n\n    }}>\n\n      <div>Hello</div>\n\n    </ViewTransition>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\n// ...\n\nstartTransition(() => {\n\n  addTransitionType('my-transition-type');\n\n  setState(newState);\n\n});\n\nIf multiple types match, then they’re joined together. If no types match then the special “default” entry is used instead. If any type has the value “none” then that wins and the ViewTransition is disabled (not assigned a name).\n\nThese can be combined with enter/exit/update/layout/share props to match based on kind of trigger and Transition Type.\n\n<ViewTransition enter={{\n\n  'navigation-back': 'enter-right',\n\n  'navigation-forward': 'enter-left',\n\n}}\n\nexit={{\n\n  'navigation-back': 'exit-right',\n\n  'navigation-forward': 'exit-left',\n\n}}>\nCustomize animations using ViewTransition events \n\nYou can imperatively customize animations for an activated ViewTransition based on type using View Transition events:\n\n<ViewTransition onUpdate={(inst, types) => {\n\n  if (types.includes('navigation-back')) {\n\n    ...\n\n  } else if (types.includes('navigation-forward')) {\n\n    ...\n\n  } else {\n\n    ...\n\n  }\n\n}}>\n\nThis allows you to pick different imperative Animations based on the cause.\n\nPREVIOUS\nact\nNEXT\ncache"

    "html": "API REFERENCE\nAPIS\ncache\nReact Server Components\n\ncache is only for use with React Server Components.\n\ncache lets you cache the result of a data fetch or computation.\n\nconst cachedFn = cache(fn);\nReference\ncache(fn)\nUsage\nCache an expensive computation\nShare a snapshot of data\nPreload data\nTroubleshooting\nMy memoized function still runs even though I’ve called it with the same arguments\nReference \ncache(fn) \n\nCall cache outside of any components to create a version of the function with caching.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport calculateMetrics from 'lib/metrics';\n\n\n\nconst getMetrics = cache(calculateMetrics);\n\n\n\nfunction Chart({data}) {\n\n  const report = getMetrics(data);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nWhen getMetrics is first called with data, getMetrics will call calculateMetrics(data) and store the result in cache. If getMetrics is called again with the same data, it will return the cached result instead of calling calculateMetrics(data) again.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \nfn: The function you want to cache results for. fn can take any arguments and return any value.\nReturns \n\ncache returns a cached version of fn with the same type signature. It does not call fn in the process.\n\nWhen calling cachedFn with given arguments, it first checks if a cached result exists in the cache. If a cached result exists, it returns the result. If not, it calls fn with the arguments, stores the result in the cache, and returns the result. The only time fn is called is when there is a cache miss.\n\nNote\n\nThe optimization of caching return values based on inputs is known as memoization. We refer to the function returned from cache as a memoized function.\n\nCaveats \nReact will invalidate the cache for all memoized functions for each server request.\nEach call to cache creates a new function. This means that calling cache with the same function multiple times will return different memoized functions that do not share the same cache.\ncachedFn will also cache errors. If fn throws an error for certain arguments, it will be cached, and the same error is re-thrown when cachedFn is called with those same arguments.\ncache is for use in Server Components only.\nUsage \nCache an expensive computation \n\nUse cache to skip duplicate work.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport calculateUserMetrics from 'lib/user';\n\n\n\nconst getUserMetrics = cache(calculateUserMetrics);\n\n\n\nfunction Profile({user}) {\n\n  const metrics = getUserMetrics(user);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction TeamReport({users}) {\n\n  for (let user in users) {\n\n    const metrics = getUserMetrics(user);\n\n    // ...\n\n  }\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIf the same user object is rendered in both Profile and TeamReport, the two components can share work and only call calculateUserMetrics once for that user.\n\nAssume Profile is rendered first. It will call getUserMetrics, and check if there is a cached result. Since it is the first time getUserMetrics is called with that user, there will be a cache miss. getUserMetrics will then call calculateUserMetrics with that user and write the result to cache.\n\nWhen TeamReport renders its list of users and reaches the same user object, it will call getUserMetrics and read the result from cache.\n\nIf calculateUserMetrics can be aborted by passing an AbortSignal, you can use cacheSignal() to cancel the expensive computation if React has finished rendering. calculateUserMetrics may already handle cancellation internally by using cacheSignal directly.\n\nPitfall\nCalling different memoized functions will read from different caches. \n\nTo access the same cache, components must call the same memoized function.\n\n// Temperature.js\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport {calculateWeekReport} from './report';\n\n\n\nexport function Temperature({cityData}) {\n\n  // 🚩 Wrong: Calling `cache` in component creates new `getWeekReport` for each render\n\n  const getWeekReport = cache(calculateWeekReport);\n\n  const report = getWeekReport(cityData);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n// Precipitation.js\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport {calculateWeekReport} from './report';\n\n\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: `getWeekReport` is only accessible for `Precipitation` component.\n\nconst getWeekReport = cache(calculateWeekReport);\n\n\n\nexport function Precipitation({cityData}) {\n\n  const report = getWeekReport(cityData);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nIn the above example, Precipitation and Temperature each call cache to create a new memoized function with their own cache look-up. If both components render for the same cityData, they will do duplicate work to call calculateWeekReport.\n\nIn addition, Temperature creates a new memoized function each time the component is rendered which doesn’t allow for any cache sharing.\n\nTo maximize cache hits and reduce work, the two components should call the same memoized function to access the same cache. Instead, define the memoized function in a dedicated module that can be import-ed across components.\n\n// getWeekReport.js\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport {calculateWeekReport} from './report';\n\n\n\nexport default cache(calculateWeekReport);\n// Temperature.js\n\nimport getWeekReport from './getWeekReport';\n\n\n\nexport default function Temperature({cityData}) {\n\n\tconst report = getWeekReport(cityData);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n// Precipitation.js\n\nimport getWeekReport from './getWeekReport';\n\n\n\nexport default function Precipitation({cityData}) {\n\n  const report = getWeekReport(cityData);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nHere, both components call the same memoized function exported from ./getWeekReport.js to read and write to the same cache.\n\nShare a snapshot of data \n\nTo share a snapshot of data between components, call cache with a data-fetching function like fetch. When multiple components make the same data fetch, only one request is made and the data returned is cached and shared across components. All components refer to the same snapshot of data across the server render.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\nimport {fetchTemperature} from './api.js';\n\n\n\nconst getTemperature = cache(async (city) => {\n\n\treturn await fetchTemperature(city);\n\n});\n\n\n\nasync function AnimatedWeatherCard({city}) {\n\n\tconst temperature = await getTemperature(city);\n\n\t// ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nasync function MinimalWeatherCard({city}) {\n\n\tconst temperature = await getTemperature(city);\n\n\t// ...\n\n}\n\nIf AnimatedWeatherCard and MinimalWeatherCard both render for the same city, they will receive the same snapshot of data from the memoized function.\n\nIf AnimatedWeatherCard and MinimalWeatherCard supply different city arguments to getTemperature, then fetchTemperature will be called twice and each call site will receive different data.\n\nThe city acts as a cache key.\n\nNote\n\nAsynchronous rendering is only supported for Server Components.\n\nasync function AnimatedWeatherCard({city}) {\n\n\tconst temperature = await getTemperature(city);\n\n\t// ...\n\n}\n\nTo render components that use asynchronous data in Client Components, see use() documentation.\n\nPreload data \n\nBy caching a long-running data fetch, you can kick off asynchronous work prior to rendering the component.\n\nconst getUser = cache(async (id) => {\n\n  return await db.user.query(id);\n\n});\n\n\n\nasync function Profile({id}) {\n\n  const user = await getUser(id);\n\n  return (\n\n    <section>\n\n      <img src={user.profilePic} />\n\n      <h2>{user.name}</h2>\n\n    </section>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Page({id}) {\n\n  // ✅ Good: start fetching the user data\n\n  getUser(id);\n\n  // ... some computational work\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <Profile id={id} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nWhen rendering Page, the component calls getUser but note that it doesn’t use the returned data. This early getUser call kicks off the asynchronous database query that occurs while Page is doing other computational work and rendering children.\n\nWhen rendering Profile, we call getUser again. If the initial getUser call has already returned and cached the user data, when Profile asks and waits for this data, it can simply read from the cache without requiring another remote procedure call. If the  initial data request hasn’t been completed, preloading data in this pattern reduces delay in data-fetching.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nCaching asynchronous work \nShow Details\nPitfall\nCalling a memoized function outside of a component will not use the cache. \nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst getUser = cache(async (userId) => {\n\n  return await db.user.query(userId);\n\n});\n\n\n\n// 🚩 Wrong: Calling memoized function outside of component will not memoize.\n\ngetUser('demo-id');\n\n\n\nasync function DemoProfile() {\n\n  // ✅ Good: `getUser` will memoize.\n\n  const user = await getUser('demo-id');\n\n  return <Profile user={user} />;\n\n}\n\nReact only provides cache access to the memoized function in a component. When calling getUser outside of a component, it will still evaluate the function but not read or update the cache.\n\nThis is because cache access is provided through a context which is only accessible from a component.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhen should I use cache, memo, or useMemo? \nShow Details\nTroubleshooting \nMy memoized function still runs even though I’ve called it with the same arguments \n\nSee prior mentioned pitfalls\n\nCalling different memoized functions will read from different caches.\nCalling a memoized function outside of a component will not use the cache.\n\nIf none of the above apply, it may be a problem with how React checks if something exists in cache.\n\nIf your arguments are not primitives (ex. objects, functions, arrays), ensure you’re passing the same object reference.\n\nWhen calling a memoized function, React will look up the input arguments to see if a result is already cached. React will use shallow equality of the arguments to determine if there is a cache hit.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst calculateNorm = cache((vector) => {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\n\n\nfunction MapMarker(props) {\n\n  // 🚩 Wrong: props is an object that changes every render.\n\n  const length = calculateNorm(props);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />\n\n      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn this case the two MapMarkers look like they’re doing the same work and calling calculateNorm with the same value of {x: 10, y: 10, z:10}. Even though the objects contain the same values, they are not the same object reference as each component creates its own props object.\n\nReact will call Object.is on the input to verify if there is a cache hit.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst calculateNorm = cache((x, y, z) => {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\n\n\nfunction MapMarker(props) {\n\n  // ✅ Good: Pass primitives to memoized function\n\n  const length = calculateNorm(props.x, props.y, props.z);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />\n\n      <MapMarker x={10} y={10} z={10} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nOne way to address this could be to pass the vector dimensions to calculateNorm. This works because the dimensions themselves are primitives.\n\nAnother solution may be to pass the vector object itself as a prop to the component. We’ll need to pass the same object to both component instances.\n\nimport {cache} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst calculateNorm = cache((vector) => {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\n\n\nfunction MapMarker(props) {\n\n  // ✅ Good: Pass the same `vector` object\n\n  const length = calculateNorm(props.vector);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const vector = [10, 10, 10];\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MapMarker vector={vector} />\n\n      <MapMarker vector={vector} />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\nPREVIOUS\naddTransitionType\nNEXT\ncacheSignal"

If you don’t have any meaningful default value, specify null. The default value is meant as a “last resort” fallback. It is static and never changes over time.\nReturns \n\ncreateContext returns a context object.\n\nThe context object itself does not hold any information. It represents which context other components read or provide. Typically, you will use SomeContext in components above to specify the context value, and call useContext(SomeContext) in components below to read it. The context object has a few properties:\n\nSomeContext lets you provide the context value to components.\nSomeContext.Consumer is an alternative and rarely used way to read the context value.\nSomeContext.Provider is a legacy way to provide the context value before React 19.\nSomeContext Provider \n\nWrap your components into a context provider to specify the value of this context for all components inside:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n\n      <Page />\n\n    </ThemeContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\nNote\n\nStarting in React 19, you can render <SomeContext> as a provider.\n\nIn older versions of React, use <SomeContext.Provider>.\n\nProps \nvalue: The value that you want to pass to all the components reading this context inside this provider, no matter how deep. The context value can be of any type. A component calling useContext(SomeContext) inside of the provider receives the value of the innermost corresponding context provider above it.\nSomeContext.Consumer \n\nBefore useContext existed, there was an older way to read context:\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  // 🟡 Legacy way (not recommended)\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext.Consumer>\n\n      {theme => (\n\n        <button className={theme} />\n\n      )}\n\n    </ThemeContext.Consumer>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nAlthough this older way still works, newly written code should read context with useContext() instead:\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  // ✅ Recommended way\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  return <button className={theme} />;\n\n}\nProps \nchildren: A function. React will call the function you pass with the current context value determined by the same algorithm as useContext() does, and render the result you return from this function. React will also re-run this function and update the UI whenever the context from the parent components changes.\nUsage \nCreating context \n\nContext lets components pass information deep down without explicitly passing props.\n\nCall createContext outside any components to create one or more contexts.\n\nimport { createContext } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nconst AuthContext = createContext(null);\n\ncreateContext returns a context object. Components can read context by passing it to useContext():\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction Profile() {\n\n  const currentUser = useContext(AuthContext);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nBy default, the values they receive will be the default values you have specified when creating the contexts. However, by itself this isn’t useful because the default values never change.\n\nContext is useful because you can provide other, dynamic values from your components:\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark');\n\n  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState({ name: 'Taylor' });\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n\n      <AuthContext value={currentUser}>\n\n        <Page />\n\n      </AuthContext>\n\n    </ThemeContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nNow the Page component and any components inside it, no matter how deep, will “see” the passed context values. If the passed context values change, React will re-render the components reading the context as well.\n\nRead more about reading and providing context and see examples.\n\nImporting and exporting context from a file \n\nOften, components in different files will need access to the same context. This is why it’s common to declare contexts in a separate file. Then you can use the export statement to make context available for other files:\n\n// Contexts.js\n\nimport { createContext } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport const ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nexport const AuthContext = createContext(null);\n\nComponents declared in other files can then use the import statement to read or provide this context:\n\n// Button.js\n\nimport { ThemeContext } from './Contexts.js';\n\n\n\nfunction Button() {\n\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n// App.js\n\nimport { ThemeContext, AuthContext } from './Contexts.js';\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n\n      <AuthContext value={currentUser}>\n\n        <Page />\n\n      </AuthContext>\n\n    </ThemeContext>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis works similar to importing and exporting components.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI can’t find a way to change the context value \n\nCode like this specifies the default context value:\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext('light');\n\nThis value never changes. React only uses this value as a fallback if it can’t find a matching provider above.\n\nTo make context change over time, add state and wrap components in a context provider.\n\nPREVIOUS\ncaptureOwnerStack\nNEXT\nlazy"

It needs to eventually resolve to an object whose .default property is a valid React component type, such as a function, memo, or a forwardRef component.\n\nUsage \nLazy-loading components with Suspense \n\nUsually, you import components with the static import declaration:\n\nimport MarkdownPreview from './MarkdownPreview.js';\n\nTo defer loading this component’s code until it’s rendered for the first time, replace this import with:\n\nimport { lazy } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MarkdownPreview = lazy(() => import('./MarkdownPreview.js'));\n\nThis code relies on dynamic import(), which might require support from your bundler or framework. Using this pattern requires that the lazy component you’re importing was exported as the default export.\n\nNow that your component’s code loads on demand, you also need to specify what should be displayed while it is loading. You can do this by wrapping the lazy component or any of its parents into a <Suspense> boundary:\n\n<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n\n  <h2>Preview</h2>\n\n  <MarkdownPreview />\n\n</Suspense>\n\nIn this example, the code for MarkdownPreview won’t be loaded until you attempt to render it. If MarkdownPreview hasn’t loaded yet, Loading will be shown in its place.

This memoized version of your component will usually not be re-rendered when its parent component is re-rendered as long as its props have not changed. But React may still re-render it: memoization is a performance optimization, not a guarantee.\n\nimport { memo } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst SomeComponent = memo(function SomeComponent(props) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nComponent: The component that you want to memoize. The memo does not modify this component, but returns a new, memoized component instead. Any valid React component, including functions and forwardRef components, is accepted.\n\noptional arePropsEqual: A function that accepts two arguments: the component’s previous props, and its new props. It should return true if the old and new props are equal: that is, if the component will render the same output and behave in the same way with the new props as with the old. Otherwise it should return false. Usually, you will not specify this function. By default, React will compare each prop with Object.is.\n\nReturns \n\nmemo returns a new React component. It behaves the same as the component provided to memo except that React will not always re-render it when its parent is being re-rendered unless its props have changed.\n\nUsage \nSkipping re-rendering when props are unchanged \n\nReact normally re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders. With memo, you can create a component that React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its new props are the same as the old props. Such a component is said to be memoized.\n\nTo memoize a component, wrap it in memo and use the value that it returns in place of your original component:\n\nconst Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n\n});\n\n\n\nexport default Greeting;\n\nA React component should always have pure rendering logic. This means that it must return the same output if its props, state, and context haven’t changed. By using memo, you are telling React that your component complies with this requirement, so React doesn’t need to re-render as long as its props haven’t changed. Even with memo, your component will re-render if its own state changes or if a context that it’s using changes.\n\nIn this example, notice that the Greeting component re-renders whenever name is changed (because that’s one of its props), but not when address is changed (because it’s not passed to Greeting as a prop):\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { memo, useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n  const [address, setAddress] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Name{': '}\n        <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Address{': '}\n        <input value={address} onChange={e => setAddress(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Greeting name={name} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {\n  console.log(\"Greeting was rendered at\", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());\n  return <h3>Hello{name && ', '}{name}!</h3>;\n});\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nYou should only rely on memo as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add memo to improve performance.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nShould you add memo everywhere? \nShow Details\nUpdating a memoized component using state \n\nEven when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when its own state changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { memo, useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n  const [address, setAddress] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Name{': '}\n        <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Address{': '}\n        <input value={address} onChange={e => setAddress(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Greeting name={name} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {\n  console.log('Greeting was rendered at', new Date().toLocaleTimeString());\n  const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState('Hello');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h3>{greeting}{name && ', '}{name}!</h3>\n      <GreetingSelector value={greeting} onChange={setGreeting} />\n    </>\n  );\n});\n\nfunction GreetingSelector({ value, onChange }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"radio\"\n          checked={value === 'Hello'}\n          onChange={e => onChange('Hello')}\n        />\n        Regular greeting\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        <input\n          type=\"radio\"\n          checked={value === 'Hello and welcome'}\n          onChange={e => onChange('Hello and welcome')}\n        />\n        Enthusiastic greeting\n      </label>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nIf you set a state variable to its current value, React will skip re-rendering your component even without memo. You may still see your component function being called an extra time, but the result will be discarded.\n\nUpdating a memoized component using a context \n\nEven when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when a context that it’s using changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, memo, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark');\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    setTheme(theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value={theme}>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        Switch theme\n      </button>\n      <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />\n    </ThemeContext>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {\n  console.log(\"Greeting was rendered at\", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  return (\n    <h3 className={theme}>Hello, {name}!</h3>\n  );\n});\n\n\nShow more\n\nTo make your component re-render only when a part of some context changes, split your component in two. Read what you need from the context in the outer component, and pass it down to a memoized child as a prop.\n\nMinimizing props changes \n\nWhen you use memo, your component re-renders whenever any prop is not shallowly equal to what it was previously. This means that React compares every prop in your component with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. Note that Object.is(3, 3) is true, but Object.is({}, {}) is false.\n\nTo get the most out of memo, minimize the times that the props change. For example, if the prop is an object, prevent the parent component from re-creating that object every time by using useMemo:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\n\n\n  const person = useMemo(\n\n    () => ({ name, age }),\n\n    [name, age]\n\n  );\n\n\n\n  return <Profile person={person} />;\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst Profile = memo(function Profile({ person }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nA better way to minimize props changes is to make sure the component accepts the minimum necessary information in its props. For example, it could accept individual values instead of a whole object:\n\nfunction Page() {\n\n  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');\n\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n\n  return <Profile name={name} age={age} />;\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst Profile = memo(function Profile({ name, age }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nEven individual values can sometimes be projected to ones that change less frequently. For example, here a component accepts a boolean indicating the presence of a value rather than the value itself:\n\nfunction GroupsLanding({ person }) {\n\n  const hasGroups = person.groups !== null;\n\n  return <CallToAction hasGroups={hasGroups} />;\n\n}\n\n\n\nconst CallToAction = memo(function CallToAction({ hasGroups }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n});\n\nWhen you need to pass a function to memoized component, either declare it outside your component so that it never changes, or useCallback to cache its definition between re-renders.\n\nSpecifying a custom comparison function \n\nIn rare cases it may be infeasible to minimize the props changes of a memoized component. In that case, you can provide a custom comparison function, which React will use to compare the old and new props instead of using shallow equality. This function is passed as a second argument to memo. It should return true only if the new props would result in the same output as the old props; otherwise it should return false.\n\nconst Chart = memo(function Chart({ dataPoints }) {\n\n  // ...\n\n}, arePropsEqual);\n\n\n\nfunction arePropsEqual(oldProps, newProps) {\n\n  return (\n\n    oldProps.dataPoints.length === newProps.dataPoints.length &&\n\n    oldProps.dataPoints.every((oldPoint, index) => {\n\n      const newPoint = newProps.dataPoints[index];\n\n      return oldPoint.x === newPoint.x && oldPoint.y === newPoint.y;\n\n    })\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIf you do this, use the Performance panel in your browser developer tools to make sure that your comparison function is actually faster than re-rendering the component. You might be surprised.\n\nWhen you do performance measurements, make sure that React is running in the production mode.\n\nPitfall\n\nIf you provide a custom arePropsEqual implementation, you must compare every prop, including functions. Functions often close over the props and state of parent components. If you return true when oldProps.onClick !== newProps.onClick, your component will keep “seeing” the props and state from a previous render inside its onClick handler, leading to very confusing bugs.\n\nAvoid doing deep equality checks inside arePropsEqual unless you are 100% sure that the data structure you’re working with has a known limited depth. Deep equality checks can become incredibly slow and can freeze your app for many seconds if someone changes the data structure later.\n\nDo I still need React.memo if I use React Compiler? \n\nWhen you enable React Compiler, you typically don’t need React.memo anymore. The compiler automatically optimizes component re-rendering for you.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nWithout React Compiler, you need React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders:\n\n// Parent re-renders every second\n\nfunction Parent() {\n\n  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const interval = setInterval(() => {\n\n      setSeconds(s => s + 1);\n\n    }, 1000);\n\n    return () => clearInterval(interval);\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <h1>Seconds: {seconds}</h1>\n\n      <ExpensiveChild name=\"John\" />\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\n\n\n// Without memo, this re-renders every second even though props don't change\n\nconst ExpensiveChild = memo(function ExpensiveChild({ name }) {\n\n  console.log('ExpensiveChild rendered');\n\n  return <div>Hello, {name}!</div>;\n\n});\n\nWith React Compiler enabled, the same optimization happens automatically:\n\n// No memo needed - compiler prevents re-renders automatically\n\nfunction ExpensiveChild({ name }) {\n\n  console.log('ExpensiveChild rendered');\n\n  return <div>Hello, {name}!</div>;\n\n}\n\nHere’s the key part of what the React Compiler generates:\n\nfunction Parent() {\n\n  const $ = _c(7);\n\n  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);\n\n  // ... other code ...\n\n\n\n  let t3;\n\n  if ($[4] === Symbol.for(\"react.memo_cache_sentinel\")) {\n\n    t3 = <ExpensiveChild name=\"John\" />;\n\n    $[4] = t3;\n\n  } else {\n\n    t3 = $[4];\n\n  }\n\n  // ... return statement ...\n\n}\n\nNotice the highlighted lines: The compiler wraps <ExpensiveChild name=\"John\" /> in a cache check. Since the name prop is always \"John\", this JSX is created once and reused on every parent re-render. This is exactly what React.memo does - it prevents the child from re-rendering when its props haven’t changed.\n\nThe React Compiler automatically:\n\nTracks that the name prop passed to ExpensiveChild hasn’t changed\nReuses the previously created JSX for <ExpensiveChild name=\"John\" />\nSkips re-rendering ExpensiveChild entirely\n\nThis means you can safely remove React.memo from your components when using React Compiler. The compiler provides the same optimization automatically, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n\nNote\n\nThe compiler’s optimization is actually more comprehensive than React.memo. It also memoizes intermediate values and expensive computations within your components, similar to combining React.memo with useMemo throughout your component tree.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy component re-renders when a prop is an object, array, or function \n\nReact compares old and new props by shallow equality: that is, it considers whether each new prop is reference-equal to the old prop. If you create a new object or array each time the parent is re-rendered, even if the individual elements are each the same, React will still consider it to be changed. Similarly, if you create a new function when rendering the parent component, React will consider it to have changed even if the function has the same definition. To avoid this, simplify props or memoize props in the parent component.\n\nPREVIOUS\nlazy\nNEXT\nstartTransition"

It searches upwards and does not consider context providers in the component from which you’re calling use(context).\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, use } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n      <Form />\n    </ThemeContext>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button show={true}>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button show={false}>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const theme = use(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <section className={className}>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Button({ show, children }) {\n  if (show) {\n    const theme = use(ThemeContext);\n    const className = 'button-' + theme;\n    return (\n      <button className={className}>\n        {children}\n      </button>\n    );\n  }\n  return false\n}\n\n\nShow more\nStreaming data from the server to the client \n\nData can be streamed from the server to the client by passing a Promise as a prop from a Server Component to a Client Component.\n\nimport { fetchMessage } from './lib.js';\n\nimport { Message } from './message.js';\n\n\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const messagePromise = fetchMessage();\n\n  return (\n\n    <Suspense fallback={<p>waiting for message...</p>}>\n\n      <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />\n\n    </Suspense>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe Client Component then takes the Promise it received as a prop and passes it to the use API. This allows the Client Component to read the value from the Promise that was initially created by the Server Component.\n\n// message.js\n\n'use client';\n\n\n\nimport { use } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport function Message({ messagePromise }) {\n\n  const messageContent = use(messagePromise);\n\n  return <p>Here is the message: {messageContent}</p>;\n\n}\n\nBecause Message is wrapped in Suspense, the fallback will be displayed until the Promise is resolved. When the Promise is resolved, the value will be read by the use API and the Message component will replace the Suspense fallback.\n\nmessage.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Message({ messagePromise }) {\n  const messageContent = use(messagePromise);\n  return <p>Here is the message: {messageContent}</p>;\n}\n\nexport function MessageContainer({ messagePromise }) {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<p>⌛Downloading message...</p>}>\n      <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nWhen passing a Promise from a Server Component to a Client Component, its resolved value must be serializable to pass between server and client. Data types like functions aren’t serializable and cannot be the resolved value of such a Promise.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nShould I resolve a Promise in a Server or Client Component? \nShow Details\nDealing with rejected Promises \n\nIn some cases a Promise passed to use could be rejected. You can handle rejected Promises by either:\n\nDisplaying an error to users with an Error Boundary.\nProviding an alternative value with Promise.catch\nPitfall\n\nuse cannot be called in a try-catch block. Instead of a try-catch block wrap your component in an Error Boundary, or provide an alternative value to use with the Promise’s .catch method.\n\nDisplaying an error to users with an Error Boundary \n\nIf you’d like to display an error to your users when a Promise is rejected, you can use an Error Boundary. To use an Error Boundary, wrap the component where you are calling the use API in an Error Boundary. If the Promise passed to use is rejected the fallback for the Error Boundary will be displayed.\n\nmessage.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from \"react\";\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\nexport function MessageContainer({ messagePromise }) {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>⚠️Something went wrong</p>}>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>⌛Downloading message...</p>}>\n        <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Message({ messagePromise }) {\n  const content = use(messagePromise);\n  return <p>Here is the message: {content}</p>;\n}\n\n\nShow more\nProviding an alternative value with Promise.catch \n\nIf you’d like to provide an alternative value when the Promise passed to use is rejected you can use the Promise’s catch method.\n\nimport { Message } from './message.js';\n\n\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const messagePromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n\n    reject();\n\n  }).catch(() => {\n\n    return \"no new message found.\";\n\n  });\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <Suspense fallback={<p>waiting for message...</p>}>\n\n      <Message messagePromise={messagePromise} />\n\n    </Suspense>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nTo use the Promise’s catch method, call catch on the Promise object. catch takes a single argument: a function that takes an error message as an argument. Whatever is returned by the function passed to catch will be used as the resolved value of the Promise.\n\nTroubleshooting \n“Suspense Exception: This is not a real error!” \n\nYou are either calling use outside of a React Component or Hook function, or calling use in a try–catch block. If you are calling use inside a try–catch block, wrap your component in an Error Boundary, or call the Promise’s catch to catch the error and resolve the Promise with another value. See these examples.\n\nIf you are calling use outside a React Component or Hook function, move the use call to a React Component or Hook function.\n\nfunction MessageComponent({messagePromise}) {\n\n  function download() {\n\n    // ❌ the function calling `use` is not a Component or Hook\n\n    const message = use(messagePromise);\n\n    // ...\n\nInstead, call use outside any component closures, where the function that calls use is a Component or Hook.\n\nfunction MessageComponent({messagePromise}) {\n\n  // ✅ `use` is being called from a component. \n\n  const message = use(messagePromise);\n\n  // ...\nPREVIOUS\nstartTransition\nNEXT\nexperimental_taintObjectReference"

Functions and class instances can be passed to taintObjectReference as object. Functions and classes are already blocked from being passed to Client Components but the React’s default error message will be replaced by what you defined in message. When a specific instance of a Typed Array is passed to taintObjectReference as object, any other copies of the Typed Array will not be tainted.\n\nReturns \n\nexperimental_taintObjectReference returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \nRecreating or cloning a tainted object creates a new untainted object which may contain sensitive data. For example, if you have a tainted user object, const userInfo = {name: user.name, ssn: user.ssn} or {...user} will create new objects which are not tainted. taintObjectReference only protects against simple mistakes when the object is passed through to a Client Component unchanged.\nPitfall\n\nDo not rely on just tainting for security. Tainting an object doesn’t prevent leaking of every possible derived value. For example, the clone of a tainted object will create a new untainted object. Using data from a tainted object (e.g. {secret: taintedObj.secret}) will create a new value or object that is not tainted. Tainting is a layer of protection; a secure app will have multiple layers of protection, well designed APIs, and isolation patterns.\n\nUsage \nPrevent user data from unintentionally reaching the client \n\nA Client Component should never accept objects that carry sensitive data. Ideally, the data fetching functions should not expose data that the current user should not have access to. Sometimes mistakes happen during refactoring. To protect against these mistakes happening down the line we can “taint” the user object in our data API.\n\nimport {experimental_taintObjectReference} from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport async function getUser(id) {\n\n  const user = await db`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;\n\n  experimental_taintObjectReference(\n\n    'Do not pass the entire user object to the client.

This message will be displayed as a part of the Error that will be thrown if value is passed to a Client Component.\n\nlifetime: Any object that indicates how long value should be tainted. value will be blocked from being sent to any Client Component while this object still exists. For example, passing globalThis blocks the value for the lifetime of an app. lifetime is typically an object whose properties contains value.\n\nvalue: A string, bigint or TypedArray. value must be a unique sequence of characters or bytes with high entropy such as a cryptographic token, private key, hash, or a long password. value will be blocked from being sent to any Client Component.\n\nReturns \n\nexperimental_taintUniqueValue returns undefined.\n\nCaveats \nDeriving new values from tainted values can compromise tainting protection. New values created by uppercasing tainted values, concatenating tainted string values into a larger string, converting tainted values to base64, substringing tainted values, and other similar transformations are not tainted unless you explicitly call taintUniqueValue on these newly created values.\nDo not use taintUniqueValue to protect low-entropy values such as PIN codes or phone numbers. If any value in a request is controlled by an attacker, they could infer which value is tainted by enumerating all possible values of the secret.\nUsage \nPrevent a token from being passed to Client Components \n\nTo ensure that sensitive information such as passwords, session tokens, or other unique values do not inadvertently get passed to Client Components, the taintUniqueValue function provides a layer of protection. When a value is tainted, any attempt to pass it to a Client Component will result in an error.\n\nThe lifetime argument defines the duration for which the value remains tainted. For values that should remain tainted indefinitely, objects like globalThis or process can serve as the lifetime argument. These objects have a lifespan that spans the entire duration of your app’s execution.\n\nimport {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';\n\n\n\nexperimental_taintUniqueValue(\n\n  'Do not pass a user password to the client.',\n\n  globalThis,\n\n  process.env.SECRET_KEY\n\n);\n\nIf the tainted value’s lifespan is tied to a object, the lifetime should be the object that encapsulates the value. This ensures the tainted value remains protected for the lifetime of the encapsulating object.\n\nimport {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport async function getUser(id) {\n\n  const user = await db`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`;\n\n  experimental_taintUniqueValue(\n\n    'Do not pass a user session token to the client.',\n\n    user,\n\n    user.session.token\n\n  );\n\n  return user;\n\n}\n\nIn this example, the user object serves as the lifetime argument. If this object gets stored in a global cache or is accessible by another request, the session token remains tainted.\n\nPitfall\n\nDo not rely solely on tainting for security. Tainting a value doesn’t block every possible derived value. For example, creating a new value by upper casing a tainted string will not taint the new value.\n\nimport {experimental_taintUniqueValue} from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst password = 'correct horse battery staple';\n\n\n\nexperimental_taintUniqueValue(\n\n  'Do not pass the password to the client.',\n\n  globalThis,\n\n  password\n\n);\n\n\n\nconst uppercasePassword = password.toUpperCase() // `uppercasePassword` is not tainted\n\nIn this example, the constant password is tainted. Then password is used to create a new value uppercasePassword by calling the toUpperCase method on password. The newly created uppercasePassword is not tainted.\n\nOther similar ways of deriving new values from tainted values like concatenating it into a larger string, converting it to base64, or returning a substring create untained values.\n\nTainting only protects against simple mistakes like explicitly passing secret values to the client. Mistakes in calling the taintUniqueValue like using a global store outside of React, without the corresponding lifetime object, can cause the tainted value to become untainted. Tainting is a layer of protection; a secure app will have multiple layers of protection, well designed APIs, and isolation patterns.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nUsing server-only and taintUniqueValue to prevent leaking secrets \nShow Details\nPREVIOUS\nexperimental_taintObjectReference"

The returned elements’ keys will be calculated from the original elements’ keys and their level of nesting and position. This ensures that flattening the array does not introduce changes in behavior.\nUsage \nTransforming children \n\nTo transform the children JSX that your component receives as the children prop, call Children.map:\n\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction RowList({ children }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"RowList\">\n\n      {Children.map(children, child =>\n\n        <div className=\"Row\">\n\n          {child}\n\n        </div>\n\n      )}\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nIn the example above, the RowList wraps every child it receives into a <div className=\"Row\"> container. For example, let’s say the parent component passes three <p> tags as the children prop to RowList:\n\n<RowList>\n\n  <p>This is the first item.</p>\n\n  <p>This is the second item.</p>\n\n  <p>This is the third item.</p>\n\n</RowList>\n\nThen, with the RowList implementation above, the final rendered result will look like this:\n\n<div className=\"RowList\">\n\n  <div className=\"Row\">\n\n    <p>This is the first item.</p>\n\n  </div>\n\n  <div className=\"Row\">\n\n    <p>This is the second item.</p>\n\n  </div>\n\n  <div className=\"Row\">\n\n    <p>This is the third item.</p>\n\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n\nChildren.map is similar to to transforming arrays with map(). The difference is that the children data structure is considered opaque. This means that even if it’s sometimes an array, you should not assume it’s an array or any other particular data type. This is why you should use Children.map if you need to transform it.\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\nexport default function RowList({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"RowList\">\n      {Children.map(children, child =>\n        <div className=\"Row\">\n          {child}\n        </div>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhy is the children prop not always an array? \nShow Details\nPitfall\n\nThe children data structure does not include rendered output of the components you pass as JSX.

This is why it’s usually better to use one of the alternative solutions.\n\nAlternatives \nNote\n\nThis section describes alternatives to the Children API (with capital C) that’s imported like this:\n\nimport { Children } from 'react';\n\nDon’t confuse it with using the children prop (lowercase c), which is good and encouraged.\n\nExposing multiple components \n\nManipulating children with the Children methods often leads to fragile code. When you pass children to a component in JSX, you don’t usually expect the component to manipulate or transform the individual children.\n\nWhen you can, try to avoid using the Children methods. For example, if you want every child of RowList to be wrapped in <div className=\"Row\">, export a Row component, and manually wrap every row into it like this:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the first item.</p>\n      </Row>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the second item.</p>\n      </Row>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the third item.</p>\n      </Row>\n    </RowList>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nUnlike using Children.map, this approach does not wrap every child automatically. However, this approach has a significant benefit compared to the earlier example with Children.map because it works even if you keep extracting more components. For example, it still works if you extract your own MoreRows component:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the first item.</p>\n      </Row>\n      <MoreRows />\n    </RowList>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction MoreRows() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the second item.</p>\n      </Row>\n      <Row>\n        <p>This is the third item.</p>\n      </Row>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis wouldn’t work with Children.map because it would “see” <MoreRows /> as a single child (and a single row).\n\nAccepting an array of objects as a prop \n\nYou can also explicitly pass an array as a prop. For example, this RowList accepts a rows array as a prop:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList rows={[\n      { id: 'first', content: <p>This is the first item.</p> },\n      { id: 'second', content: <p>This is the second item.</p> },\n      { id: 'third', content: <p>This is the third item.</p> }\n    ]} />\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nSince rows is a regular JavaScript array, the RowList component can use built-in array methods like map on it.\n\nThis pattern is especially useful when you want to be able to pass more information as structured data together with children. In the below example, the TabSwitcher component receives an array of objects as the tabs prop:\n\nApp.js\nTabSwitcher.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport TabSwitcher from './TabSwitcher.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <TabSwitcher tabs={[\n      {\n        id: 'first',\n        header: 'First',\n        content: <p>This is the first item.</p>\n      },\n      {\n        id: 'second',\n        header: 'Second',\n        content: <p>This is the second item.</p>\n      },\n      {\n        id: 'third',\n        header: 'Third',\n        content: <p>This is the third item.</p>\n      }\n    ]} />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nUnlike passing the children as JSX, this approach lets you associate some extra data like header with each item. Because you are working with the tabs directly, and it is an array, you do not need the Children methods.\n\nCalling a render prop to customize rendering \n\nInstead of producing JSX for every single item, you can also pass a function that returns JSX, and call that function when necessary. In this example, the App component passes a renderContent function to the TabSwitcher component. The TabSwitcher component calls renderContent only for the selected tab:\n\nApp.js\nTabSwitcher.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport TabSwitcher from './TabSwitcher.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <TabSwitcher\n      tabIds={['first', 'second', 'third']}\n      getHeader={tabId => {\n        return tabId[0].toUpperCase() + tabId.slice(1);\n      }}\n      renderContent={tabId => {\n        return <p>This is the {tabId} item.</p>;\n      }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\n\nA prop like renderContent is called a render prop because it is a prop that specifies how to render a piece of the user interface. However, there is nothing special about it: it is a regular prop which happens to be a function.\n\nRender props are functions, so you can pass information to them. For example, this RowList component passes the id and the index of each row to the renderRow render prop, which uses index to highlight even rows:\n\nApp.js\nRowList.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { RowList, Row } from './RowList.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <RowList\n      rowIds={['first', 'second', 'third']}\n      renderRow={(id, index) => {\n        return (\n          <Row isHighlighted={index % 2 === 0}>\n            <p>This is the {id} item.</p>\n          </Row> \n        );\n      }}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis is another example of how parent and child components can cooperate without manipulating the children.\n\nTroubleshooting \nI pass a custom component, but the Children methods don’t show its render result \n\nSuppose you pass two children to RowList like this:\n\n<RowList>\n\n  <p>First item</p>\n\n  <MoreRows />\n\n</RowList>\n\nIf you do Children.count(children) inside RowList, you will get 2. Even if MoreRows renders 10 different items, or if it returns null, Children.count(children) will still be 2. From the RowList’s perspective, it only “sees” the JSX it has received. It does not “see” the internals of the MoreRows component.\n\nThe limitation makes it hard to extract a component. This is why alternatives are preferred to using Children.\n\nPREVIOUS\nLegacy React APIs\nNEXT\ncloneElement"

See common alternatives.\n\ncloneElement lets you create a new React element using another element as a starting point.\n\nconst clonedElement = cloneElement(element, props, ...children)\nReference\ncloneElement(element, props, ...children)\nUsage\nOverriding props of an element\nAlternatives\nPassing data with a render prop\nPassing data through context\nExtracting logic into a custom Hook\nReference \ncloneElement(element, props, ...children) \n\nCall cloneElement to create a React element based on the element, but with different props and children:\n\nimport { cloneElement } from 'react';\n\n\n\n// ...\n\nconst clonedElement = cloneElement(\n\n  <Row title=\"Cabbage\">\n\n    Hello\n\n  </Row>,\n\n  { isHighlighted: true },\n\n  'Goodbye'\n\n);\n\n\n\nconsole.log(clonedElement); // <Row title=\"Cabbage\" isHighlighted={true}>Goodbye</Row>\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\nelement: The element argument must be a valid React element. For example, it could be a JSX node like <Something />, the result of calling createElement, or the result of another cloneElement call.\n\nprops: The props argument must either be an object or null. If you pass null, the cloned element will retain all of the original element.props. Otherwise, for every prop in the props object, the returned element will “prefer” the value from props over the value from element.props. The rest of the props will be filled from the original element.props. If you pass props.key or props.ref, they will replace the original ones.\n\noptional ...children: Zero or more child nodes. They can be any React nodes, including React elements, strings, numbers, portals, empty nodes (null, undefined, true, and false), and arrays of React nodes. If you don’t pass any ...children arguments, the original element.props.children will be preserved.\n\nReturns \n\ncloneElement returns a React element object with a few properties:\n\ntype: Same as element.type.\nprops: The result of shallowly merging element.props with the overriding props you have passed.\nref: The original element.ref, unless it was overridden by props.ref.\nkey: The original element.key, unless it was overridden by props.key.\n\nUsually, you’ll return the element from your component or make it a child of another element. Although you may read the element’s properties, it’s best to treat every element as opaque after it’s created, and only render it.\n\nCaveats \n\nCloning an element does not modify the original element.\n\nYou should only pass children as multiple arguments to cloneElement if they are all statically known, like cloneElement(element, null, child1, child2, child3). If your children are dynamic, pass the entire array as the third argument: cloneElement(element, null, listItems). This ensures that React will warn you about missing keys for any dynamic lists. For static lists this is not necessary because they never reorder.\n\ncloneElement makes it harder to trace the data flow, so try the alternatives instead.\n\nUsage \nOverriding props of an element \n\nTo override the props of some React element, pass it to cloneElement with the props you want to override:\n\nimport { cloneElement } from 'react';\n\n\n\n// ...\n\nconst clonedElement = cloneElement(\n\n  <Row title=\"Cabbage\" />,\n\n  { isHighlighted: true }\n\n);\n\nHere, the resulting cloned element will be <Row title=\"Cabbage\" isHighlighted={true} />.\n\nLet’s walk through an example to see when it’s useful.\n\nImagine a List component that renders its children as a list of selectable rows with a “Next” button that changes which row is selected. The List component needs to render the selected Row differently, so it clones every <Row> child that it has received, and adds an extra isHighlighted: true or isHighlighted: false prop:\n\nexport default function List({ children }) {\n\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"List\">\n\n      {Children.map(children, (child, index) =>\n\n        cloneElement(child, {\n\n          isHighlighted: index === selectedIndex \n\n        })\n\n      )}\n\nLet’s say the original JSX received by List looks like this:\n\n<List>\n\n  <Row title=\"Cabbage\" />\n\n  <Row title=\"Garlic\" />\n\n  <Row title=\"Apple\" />\n\n</List>\n\nBy cloning its children, the List can pass extra information to every Row inside. The result looks like this:\n\n<List>\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Cabbage\"\n\n    isHighlighted={true} \n\n  />\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Garlic\"\n\n    isHighlighted={false} \n\n  />\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Apple\"\n\n    isHighlighted={false} \n\n  />\n\n</List>\n\nNotice how pressing “Next” updates the state of the List, and highlights a different row:\n\nApp.js\nList.js\nRow.js\ndata.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Children, cloneElement, useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function List({ children }) {\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {Children.map(children, (child, index) =>\n        cloneElement(child, {\n          isHighlighted: index === selectedIndex \n        })\n      )}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setSelectedIndex(i =>\n          (i + 1) % Children.count(children)\n        );\n      }}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nTo summarize, the List cloned the <Row /> elements it received and added an extra prop to them.\n\nPitfall\n\nCloning children makes it hard to tell how the data flows through your app. Try one of the alternatives.\n\nAlternatives \nPassing data with a render prop \n\nInstead of using cloneElement, consider accepting a render prop like renderItem. Here, List receives renderItem as a prop. List calls renderItem for every item and passes isHighlighted as an argument:\n\nexport default function List({ items, renderItem }) {\n\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"List\">\n\n      {items.map((item, index) => {\n\n        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;\n\n        return renderItem(item, isHighlighted);\n\n      })}\n\nThe renderItem prop is called a “render prop” because it’s a prop that specifies how to render something. For example, you can pass a renderItem implementation that renders a <Row> with the given isHighlighted value:\n\n<List\n\n  items={products}\n\n  renderItem={(product, isHighlighted) =>\n\n    <Row\n\n      key={product.id}\n\n      title={product.title}\n\n      isHighlighted={isHighlighted}\n\n    />\n\n  }\n\n/>\n\nThe end result is the same as with cloneElement:\n\n<List>\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Cabbage\"\n\n    isHighlighted={true} \n\n  />\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Garlic\"\n\n    isHighlighted={false} \n\n  />\n\n  <Row\n\n    title=\"Apple\"\n\n    isHighlighted={false} \n\n  />\n\n</List>\n\nHowever, you can clearly trace where the isHighlighted value is coming from.\n\nApp.js\nList.js\nRow.js\ndata.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function List({ items, renderItem }) {\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {items.map((item, index) => {\n        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;\n        return renderItem(item, isHighlighted);\n      })}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setSelectedIndex(i =>\n          (i + 1) % items.length\n        );\n      }}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis pattern is preferred to cloneElement because it is more explicit.\n\nPassing data through context \n\nAnother alternative to cloneElement is to pass data through context.\n\nFor example, you can call createContext to define a HighlightContext:\n\nexport const HighlightContext = createContext(false);\n\nYour List component can wrap every item it renders into a HighlightContext provider:\n\nexport default function List({ items, renderItem }) {\n\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"List\">\n\n      {items.map((item, index) => {\n\n        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;\n\n        return (\n\n          <HighlightContext key={item.id} value={isHighlighted}>\n\n            {renderItem(item)}\n\n          </HighlightContext>\n\n        );\n\n      })}\n\nWith this approach, Row does not need to receive an isHighlighted prop at all. Instead, it reads the context:\n\nexport default function Row({ title }) {\n\n  const isHighlighted = useContext(HighlightContext);\n\n  // ...\n\nThis allows the calling component to not know or worry about passing isHighlighted to <Row>:\n\n<List\n\n  items={products}\n\n  renderItem={product =>\n\n    <Row title={product.title} />\n\n  }\n\n/>\n\nInstead, List and Row coordinate the highlighting logic through context.\n\nApp.js\nList.js\nRow.js\nHighlightContext.js\ndata.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { HighlightContext } from './HighlightContext.js';\n\nexport default function List({ items, renderItem }) {\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {items.map((item, index) => {\n        const isHighlighted = index === selectedIndex;\n        return (\n          <HighlightContext\n            key={item.id}\n            value={isHighlighted}\n          >\n            {renderItem(item)}\n          </HighlightContext>\n        );\n      })}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setSelectedIndex(i =>\n          (i + 1) % items.length\n        );\n      }}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nLearn more about passing data through context.\n\nExtracting logic into a custom Hook \n\nAnother approach you can try is to extract the “non-visual” logic into your own Hook, and use the information returned by your Hook to decide what to render. For example, you could write a useList custom Hook like this:\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\n\n\nexport default function useList(items) {\n\n  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);\n\n\n\n  function onNext() {\n\n    setSelectedIndex(i =>\n\n      (i + 1) % items.length\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  const selected = items[selectedIndex];\n\n  return [selected, onNext];\n\n}\n\nThen you could use it like this:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const [selected, onNext] = useList(products);\n\n  return (\n\n    <div className=\"List\">\n\n      {products.map(product =>\n\n        <Row\n\n          key={product.id}\n\n          title={product.title}\n\n          isHighlighted={selected === product}\n\n        />\n\n      )}\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <button onClick={onNext}>\n\n        Next\n\n      </button>\n\n    </div>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe data flow is explicit, but the state is inside the useList custom Hook that you can use from any component:\n\nApp.js\nuseList.js\nRow.js\ndata.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport Row from './Row.js';\nimport useList from './useList.js';\nimport { products } from './data.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [selected, onNext] = useList(products);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {products.map(product =>\n        <Row\n          key={product.id}\n          title={product.title}\n          isHighlighted={selected === product}\n        />\n      )}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={onNext}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nThis approach is particularly useful if you want to reuse this logic between different components.\n\nPREVIOUS\nChildren\nNEXT\nComponent"

If you don’t do that, this.props will be undefined while the constructor runs, which can be confusing and cause bugs.\n\nConstructor is the only place where you can assign this.state directly. In all other methods, you need to use this.setState() instead. Do not call setState in the constructor.\n\nWhen you use server rendering, the constructor will run on the server too, followed by the render method. However, lifecycle methods like componentDidMount or componentWillUnmount will not run on the server.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will call constructor twice in development and then throw away one of the instances. This helps you notice the accidental side effects that need to be moved out of the constructor.\n\nNote\n\nThere is no exact equivalent for constructor in function components. To declare state in a function component, call useState. To avoid recalculating the initial state, pass a function to useState.\n\ncomponentDidCatch(error, info) \n\nIf you define componentDidCatch, React will call it when some child component (including distant children) throws an error during rendering. This lets you log that error to an error reporting service in production.\n\nTypically, it is used together with static getDerivedStateFromError which lets you update state in response to an error and display an error message to the user. A component with these methods is called an Error Boundary.\n\nSee an example.\n\nParameters \n\nerror: The error that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of Error but this is not guaranteed because JavaScript allows to throw any value, including strings or even null.\n\ninfo: An object containing additional information about the error. Its componentStack field contains a stack trace with the component that threw, as well as the names and source locations of all its parent components. In production, the component names will be minified. If you set up production error reporting, you can decode the component stack using sourcemaps the same way as you would do for regular JavaScript error stacks.\n\nReturns \n\ncomponentDidCatch should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nIn the past, it was common to call setState inside componentDidCatch in order to update the UI and display the fallback error message. This is deprecated in favor of defining static getDerivedStateFromError.\n\nProduction and development builds of React slightly differ in the way componentDidCatch handles errors. In development, the errors will bubble up to window, which means that any window.onerror or window.addEventListener('error', callback) will intercept the errors that have been caught by componentDidCatch. In production, instead, the errors will not bubble up, which means any ancestor error handler will only receive errors not explicitly caught by componentDidCatch.\n\nNote\n\nThere is no direct equivalent for componentDidCatch in function components yet. If you’d like to avoid creating class components, write a single ErrorBoundary component like above and use it throughout your app. Alternatively, you can use the react-error-boundary package which does that for you.\n\ncomponentDidMount() \n\nIf you define the componentDidMount method, React will call it when your component is added (mounted) to the screen. This is a common place to start data fetching, set up subscriptions, or manipulate the DOM nodes.\n\nIf you implement componentDidMount, you usually need to implement other lifecycle methods to avoid bugs. For example, if componentDidMount reads some state or props, you also have to implement componentDidUpdate to handle their changes, and componentWillUnmount to clean up whatever componentDidMount was doing.\n\nclass ChatRoom extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n\n    this.setupConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n\n    if (\n\n      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||\n\n      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl\n\n    ) {\n\n      this.destroyConnection();\n\n      this.setupConnection();\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n\n    this.destroyConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSee more examples.\n\nParameters \n\ncomponentDidMount does not take any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\ncomponentDidMount should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, in development React will call componentDidMount, then immediately call componentWillUnmount, and then call componentDidMount again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement componentWillUnmount or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what componentDidMount does.\n\nAlthough you may call setState immediately in componentDidMount, it’s best to avoid that when you can. It will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen. This guarantees that even though the render will be called twice in this case, the user won’t see the intermediate state. Use this pattern with caution because it often causes performance issues. In most cases, you should be able to assign the initial state in the constructor instead. It can, however, be necessary for cases like modals and tooltips when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position.\n\nNote\n\nFor many use cases, defining componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount together in class components is equivalent to calling useEffect in function components. In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, useLayoutEffect is a closer match.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\ncomponentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot?) \n\nIf you define the componentDidUpdate method, React will call it immediately after your component has been re-rendered with updated props or state.  This method is not called for the initial render.\n\nYou can use it to manipulate the DOM after an update. This is also a common place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props (e.g. a network request may not be necessary if the props have not changed). Typically, you’d use it together with componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount:\n\nclass ChatRoom extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n\n    this.setupConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n\n    if (\n\n      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||\n\n      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl\n\n    ) {\n\n      this.destroyConnection();\n\n      this.setupConnection();\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n\n    this.destroyConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSee more examples.\n\nParameters \n\nprevProps: Props before the update. Compare prevProps to this.props to determine what changed.\n\nprevState: State before the update. Compare prevState to this.state to determine what changed.\n\nsnapshot: If you implemented getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, snapshot will contain the value you returned from that method. Otherwise, it will be undefined.\n\nReturns \n\ncomponentDidUpdate should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\ncomponentDidUpdate will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.\n\nThe logic inside componentDidUpdate should usually be wrapped in conditions comparing this.props with prevProps, and this.state with prevState. Otherwise, there’s a risk of creating infinite loops.\n\nAlthough you may call setState immediately in componentDidUpdate, it’s best to avoid that when you can. It will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen. This guarantees that even though the render will be called twice in this case, the user won’t see the intermediate state. This pattern often causes performance issues, but it may be necessary for rare cases like modals and tooltips when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position.\n\nNote\n\nFor many use cases, defining componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount together in class components is equivalent to calling useEffect in function components. In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, useLayoutEffect is a closer match.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\ncomponentWillMount() \nDeprecated\n\nThis API has been renamed from componentWillMount to UNSAFE_componentWillMount. The old name has been deprecated. In a future major version of React, only the new name will work.\n\nRun the rename-unsafe-lifecycles codemod to automatically update your components.\n\ncomponentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) \nDeprecated\n\nThis API has been renamed from componentWillReceiveProps to UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps. The old name has been deprecated. In a future major version of React, only the new name will work.\n\nRun the rename-unsafe-lifecycles codemod to automatically update your components.\n\ncomponentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) \nDeprecated\n\nThis API has been renamed from componentWillUpdate to UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate. The old name has been deprecated. In a future major version of React, only the new name will work.\n\nRun the rename-unsafe-lifecycles codemod to automatically update your components.\n\ncomponentWillUnmount() \n\nIf you define the componentWillUnmount method, React will call it before your component is removed (unmounted) from the screen. This is a common place to cancel data fetching or remove subscriptions.\n\nThe logic inside componentWillUnmount should “mirror” the logic inside componentDidMount. For example, if componentDidMount sets up a subscription, componentWillUnmount should clean up that subscription. If the cleanup logic in your componentWillUnmount reads some props or state, you will usually also need to implement componentDidUpdate to clean up resources (such as subscriptions) corresponding to the old props and state.\n\nclass ChatRoom extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n\n    this.setupConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n\n    if (\n\n      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||\n\n      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl\n\n    ) {\n\n      this.destroyConnection();\n\n      this.setupConnection();\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n\n    this.destroyConnection();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nSee more examples.\n\nParameters \n\ncomponentWillUnmount does not take any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\ncomponentWillUnmount should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \nWhen Strict Mode is on, in development React will call componentDidMount, then immediately call componentWillUnmount, and then call componentDidMount again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement componentWillUnmount or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what componentDidMount does.\nNote\n\nFor many use cases, defining componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount together in class components is equivalent to calling useEffect in function components. In the rare cases where it’s important for the code to run before browser paint, useLayoutEffect is a closer match.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\nforceUpdate(callback?) \n\nForces a component to re-render.\n\nUsually, this is not necessary. If your component’s render method only reads from this.props, this.state, or this.context, it will re-render automatically when you call setState inside your component or one of its parents. However, if your component’s render method reads directly from an external data source, you have to tell React to update the user interface when that data source changes. That’s what forceUpdate lets you do.\n\nTry to avoid all uses of forceUpdate and only read from this.props and this.state in render.\n\nParameters \noptional callback If specified, React will call the callback you’ve provided after the update is committed.\nReturns \n\nforceUpdate does not return anything.\n\nCaveats \nIf you call forceUpdate, React will re-render without calling shouldComponentUpdate.\nNote\n\nReading an external data source and forcing class components to re-render in response to its changes with forceUpdate has been superseded by useSyncExternalStore in function components.\n\ngetSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) \n\nIf you implement getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, React will call it immediately before React updates the DOM. It enables your component to capture some information from the DOM (e.g. scroll position) before it is potentially changed. Any value returned by this lifecycle method will be passed as a parameter to componentDidUpdate.\n\nFor example, you can use it in a UI like a chat thread that needs to preserve its scroll position during updates:\n\nclass ScrollingList extends React.Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n\n    super(props);\n\n    this.listRef = React.createRef();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n\n    // Are we adding new items to the list?\n\n    // Capture the scroll position so we can adjust scroll later.\n\n    if (prevProps.list.length < this.props.list.length) {\n\n      const list = this.listRef.current;\n\n      return list.scrollHeight - list.scrollTop;\n\n    }\n\n    return null;\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {\n\n    // If we have a snapshot value, we've just added new items.\n\n    // Adjust scroll so these new items don't push the old ones out of view.\n\n    // (snapshot here is the value returned from getSnapshotBeforeUpdate)\n\n    if (snapshot !== null) {\n\n      const list = this.listRef.current;\n\n      list.scrollTop = list.scrollHeight - snapshot;\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    return (\n\n      <div ref={this.listRef}>{/* ...contents... */}</div>\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nIn the above example, it is important to read the scrollHeight property directly in getSnapshotBeforeUpdate. It is not safe to read it in render, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps, or UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate because there is a potential time gap between these methods getting called and React updating the DOM.\n\nParameters \n\nprevProps: Props before the update. Compare prevProps to this.props to determine what changed.\n\nprevState: State before the update. Compare prevState to this.state to determine what changed.\n\nReturns \n\nYou should return a snapshot value of any type that you’d like, or null. The value you returned will be passed as the third argument to componentDidUpdate.\n\nCaveats \ngetSnapshotBeforeUpdate will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.\nNote\n\nAt the moment, there is no equivalent to getSnapshotBeforeUpdate for function components. This use case is very uncommon, but if you have the need for it, for now you’ll have to write a class component.\n\nrender() \n\nThe render method is the only required method in a class component.\n\nThe render method should specify what you want to appear on the screen, for example:\n\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\n\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nReact may call render at any moment, so you shouldn’t assume that it runs at a particular time. Usually, the render method should return a piece of JSX, but a few other return types (like strings) are supported. To calculate the returned JSX, the render method can read this.props, this.state, and this.context.\n\nYou should write the render method as a pure function, meaning that it should return the same result if props, state, and context are the same. It also shouldn’t contain side effects (like setting up subscriptions) or interact with the browser APIs. Side effects should happen either in event handlers or methods like componentDidMount.\n\nParameters \n\nrender does not take any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\nrender can return any valid React node. This includes React elements such as <div />, strings, numbers, portals, empty nodes (null, undefined, true, and false), and arrays of React nodes.\n\nCaveats \n\nrender should be written as a pure function of props, state, and context. It should not have side effects.\n\nrender will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will call render twice in development and then throw away one of the results. This helps you notice the accidental side effects that need to be moved out of the render method.\n\nThere is no one-to-one correspondence between the render call and the subsequent componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate call. Some of the render call results may be discarded by React when it’s beneficial.\n\nsetState(nextState, callback?) \n\nCall setState to update the state of your React component.\n\nclass Form extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    name: 'Taylor',\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  handleNameChange = (e) => {\n\n    const newName = e.target.value;\n\n    this.setState({\n\n      name: newName\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    return (\n\n      <>\n\n        <input value={this.state.name} onChange={this.handleNameChange} />\n\n        <p>Hello, {this.state.name}.</p>\n\n      </>\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nsetState enqueues changes to the component state. It tells React that this component and its children need to re-render with the new state. This is the main way you’ll update the user interface in response to interactions.\n\nPitfall\n\nCalling setState does not change the current state in the already executing code:\n\nfunction handleClick() {\n\n  console.log(this.state.name); // \"Taylor\"\n\n  this.setState({\n\n    name: 'Robin'\n\n  });\n\n  console.log(this.state.name); // Still \"Taylor\"!\n\n}\n\nIt only affects what this.state will return starting from the next render.\n\nYou can also pass a function to setState. It lets you update state based on the previous state:\n\n  handleIncreaseAge = () => {\n\n    this.setState(prevState => {\n\n      return {\n\n        age: prevState.age + 1\n\n      };\n\n    });\n\n  }\n\nYou don’t have to do this, but it’s handy if you want to update state multiple times during the same event.\n\nParameters \n\nnextState: Either an object or a function.\n\nIf you pass an object as nextState, it will be shallowly merged into this.state.\nIf you pass a function as nextState, it will be treated as an updater function. It must be pure, should take the pending state and props as arguments, and should return the object to be shallowly merged into this.state. React will put your updater function in a queue and re-render your component. During the next render, React will calculate the next state by applying all of the queued updaters to the previous state.\n\noptional callback: If specified, React will call the callback you’ve provided after the update is committed.\n\nReturns \n\nsetState does not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nThink of setState as a request rather than an immediate command to update the component. When multiple components update their state in response to an event, React will batch their updates and re-render them together in a single pass at the end of the event. In the rare case that you need to force a particular state update to be applied synchronously, you may wrap it in flushSync, but this may hurt performance.\n\nsetState does not update this.state immediately. This makes reading this.state right after calling setState a potential pitfall. Instead, use componentDidUpdate or the setState callback argument, either of which are guaranteed to fire after the update has been applied. If you need to set the state based on the previous state, you can pass a function to nextState as described above.\n\nNote\n\nCalling setState in class components is similar to calling a set function in function components.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\nshouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState, nextContext) \n\nIf you define shouldComponentUpdate, React will call it to determine whether a re-render can be skipped.\n\nIf you are confident you want to write it by hand, you may compare this.props with nextProps and this.state with nextState and return false to tell React the update can be skipped.\n\nclass Rectangle extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    isHovered: false\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n\n    if (\n\n      nextProps.position.x === this.props.position.x &&\n\n      nextProps.position.y === this.props.position.y &&\n\n      nextProps.size.width === this.props.size.width &&\n\n      nextProps.size.height === this.props.size.height &&\n\n      nextState.isHovered === this.state.isHovered\n\n    ) {\n\n      // Nothing has changed, so a re-render is unnecessary\n\n      return false;\n\n    }\n\n    return true;\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nReact calls shouldComponentUpdate before rendering when new props or state are being received. Defaults to true. This method is not called for the initial render or when forceUpdate is used.\n\nParameters \nnextProps: The next props that the component is about to render with. Compare nextProps to this.props to determine what changed.\nnextState: The next state that the component is about to render with. Compare nextState to this.state to determine what changed.\nnextContext: The next context that the component is about to render with. Compare nextContext to this.context to determine what changed. Only available if you specify static contextType.\nReturns \n\nReturn true if you want the component to re-render. That’s the default behavior.\n\nReturn false to tell React that re-rendering can be skipped.\n\nCaveats \n\nThis method only exists as a performance optimization. If your component breaks without it, fix that first.\n\nConsider using PureComponent instead of writing shouldComponentUpdate by hand. PureComponent shallowly compares props and state, and reduces the chance that you’ll skip a necessary update.\n\nWe do not recommend doing deep equality checks or using JSON.stringify in shouldComponentUpdate. It makes performance unpredictable and dependent on the data structure of every prop and state. In the best case, you risk introducing multi-second stalls to your application, and in the worst case you risk crashing it.\n\nReturning false does not prevent child components from re-rendering when their state changes.\n\nReturning false does not guarantee that the component will not re-render. React will use the return value as a hint but it may still choose to re-render your component if it makes sense to do for other reasons.\n\nNote\n\nOptimizing class components with shouldComponentUpdate is similar to optimizing function components with memo. Function components also offer more granular optimization with useMemo.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount() \n\nIf you define UNSAFE_componentWillMount, React will call it immediately after the constructor. It only exists for historical reasons and should not be used in any new code. Instead, use one of the alternatives:\n\nTo initialize state, declare state as a class field or set this.state inside the constructor.\nIf you need to run a side effect or set up a subscription, move that logic to componentDidMount instead.\n\nSee examples of migrating away from unsafe lifecycles.\n\nParameters \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount does not take any parameters.\n\nReturns \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount will not get called if the component implements static getDerivedStateFromProps or getSnapshotBeforeUpdate.\n\nDespite its naming, UNSAFE_componentWillMount does not guarantee that the component will get mounted if your app uses modern React features like Suspense. If a render attempt is suspended (for example, because the code for some child component has not loaded yet), React will throw the in-progress tree away and attempt to construct the component from scratch during the next attempt. This is why this method is “unsafe”. Code that relies on mounting (like adding a subscription) should go into componentDidMount.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillMount is the only lifecycle method that runs during server rendering. For all practical purposes, it is identical to constructor, so you should use the constructor for this type of logic instead.\n\nNote\n\nCalling setState inside UNSAFE_componentWillMount in a class component to initialize state is equivalent to passing that state as the initial state to useState in a function component.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps, nextContext) \n\nIf you define UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps, React will call it when the component receives new props. It only exists for historical reasons and should not be used in any new code. Instead, use one of the alternatives:\n\nIf you need to run a side effect (for example, fetch data, run an animation, or reinitialize a subscription) in response to prop changes, move that logic to componentDidUpdate instead.\nIf you need to avoid re-computing some data only when a prop changes, use a memoization helper instead.\nIf you need to “reset” some state when a prop changes, consider either making a component fully controlled or fully uncontrolled with a key instead.\nIf you need to “adjust” some state when a prop changes, check whether you can compute all the necessary information from props alone during rendering. If you can’t, use static getDerivedStateFromProps instead.\n\nSee examples of migrating away from unsafe lifecycles.\n\nParameters \nnextProps: The next props that the component is about to receive from its parent component. Compare nextProps to this.props to determine what changed.\nnextContext: The next context that the component is about to receive from the closest provider. Compare nextContext to this.context to determine what changed. Only available if you specify static contextType.\nReturns \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps will not get called if the component implements static getDerivedStateFromProps or getSnapshotBeforeUpdate.\n\nDespite its naming, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps does not guarantee that the component will receive those props if your app uses modern React features like Suspense. If a render attempt is suspended (for example, because the code for some child component has not loaded yet), React will throw the in-progress tree away and attempt to construct the component from scratch during the next attempt. By the time of the next render attempt, the props might be different. This is why this method is “unsafe”. Code that should run only for committed updates (like resetting a subscription) should go into componentDidUpdate.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps does not mean that the component has received different props than the last time. You need to compare nextProps and this.props yourself to check if something changed.\n\nReact doesn’t call UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps with initial props during mounting. It only calls this method if some of component’s props are going to be updated. For example, calling setState doesn’t generally trigger UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps inside the same component.\n\nNote\n\nCalling setState inside UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps in a class component to “adjust” state is equivalent to calling the set function from useState during rendering in a function component.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState) \n\nIf you define UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate, React will call it before rendering with the new props or state. It only exists for historical reasons and should not be used in any new code. Instead, use one of the alternatives:\n\nIf you need to run a side effect (for example, fetch data, run an animation, or reinitialize a subscription) in response to prop or state changes, move that logic to componentDidUpdate instead.\nIf you need to read some information from the DOM (for example, to save the current scroll position) so that you can use it in componentDidUpdate later, read it inside getSnapshotBeforeUpdate instead.\n\nSee examples of migrating away from unsafe lifecycles.\n\nParameters \nnextProps: The next props that the component is about to render with. Compare nextProps to this.props to determine what changed.\nnextState: The next state that the component is about to render with. Compare nextState to this.state to determine what changed.\nReturns \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillUpdate should not return anything.\n\nCaveats \n\nUNSAFE_componentWillUpdate will not get called if shouldComponentUpdate is defined and returns false.\n\nUNSAFE_componentWillUpdate will not get called if the component implements static getDerivedStateFromProps or getSnapshotBeforeUpdate.\n\nIt’s not supported to call setState (or any method that leads to setState being called, like dispatching a Redux action) during componentWillUpdate.\n\nDespite its naming, UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate does not guarantee that the component will update if your app uses modern React features like Suspense. If a render attempt is suspended (for example, because the code for some child component has not loaded yet), React will throw the in-progress tree away and attempt to construct the component from scratch during the next attempt.

The context you specify as the static contextType must be a value previously created by createContext.\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n\n  static contextType = ThemeContext;\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    const theme = this.context;\n\n    const className = 'button-' + theme;\n\n    return (\n\n      <button className={className}>\n\n        {this.props.children}\n\n      </button>\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n}\nNote\n\nReading this.context in class components is equivalent to useContext in function components.\n\nSee how to migrate.\n\nstatic defaultProps \n\nYou can define static defaultProps to set the default props for the class. They will be used for undefined and missing props, but not for null props.\n\nFor example, here is how you define that the color prop should default to 'blue':\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n\n  static defaultProps = {\n\n    color: 'blue'\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    return <button className={this.props.color}>click me</button>;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nIf the color prop is not provided or is undefined, it will be set by default to 'blue':\n\n<>\n\n  {/* this.props.color is \"blue\" */}\n\n  <Button />\n\n\n\n  {/* this.props.color is \"blue\" */}\n\n  <Button color={undefined} />\n\n\n\n  {/* this.props.color is null */}\n\n  <Button color={null} />\n\n\n\n  {/* this.props.color is \"red\" */}\n\n  <Button color=\"red\" />\n\n</>\nNote\n\nDefining defaultProps in class components is similar to using default values in function components.\n\nstatic getDerivedStateFromError(error) \n\nIf you define static getDerivedStateFromError, React will call it when a child component (including distant children) throws an error during rendering. This lets you display an error message instead of clearing the UI.\n\nTypically, it is used together with componentDidCatch which lets you send the error report to some analytics service. A component with these methods is called an Error Boundary.\n\nSee an example.\n\nParameters \nerror: The error that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of Error but this is not guaranteed because JavaScript allows to throw any value, including strings or even null.\nReturns \n\nstatic getDerivedStateFromError should return the state telling the component to display the error message.\n\nCaveats \nstatic getDerivedStateFromError should be a pure function. If you want to perform a side effect (for example, to call an analytics service), you need to also implement componentDidCatch.\nNote\n\nThere is no direct equivalent for static getDerivedStateFromError in function components yet. If you’d like to avoid creating class components, write a single ErrorBoundary component like above and use it throughout your app. Alternatively, use the react-error-boundary package which does that.\n\nstatic getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) \n\nIf you define static getDerivedStateFromProps, React will call it right before calling render, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates. It should return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing.\n\nThis method exists for rare use cases where the state depends on changes in props over time. For example, this Form component resets the email state when the userID prop changes:\n\nclass Form extends Component {\n\n  state = {\n\n    email: this.props.defaultEmail,\n\n    prevUserID: this.props.userID\n\n  };\n\n\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {\n\n    // Any time the current user changes,\n\n    // Reset any parts of state that are tied to that user.\n\n    // In this simple example, that's just the email.\n\n    if (props.userID !== state.prevUserID) {\n\n      return {\n\n        prevUserID: props.userID,\n\n        email: props.defaultEmail\n\n      };\n\n    }\n\n    return null;\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nNote that this pattern requires you to keep a previous value of the prop (like userID) in state (like prevUserID).\n\nPitfall\n\nDeriving state leads to verbose code and makes your components difficult to think about. Make sure you’re familiar with simpler alternatives:\n\nIf you need to perform a side effect (for example, data fetching or an animation) in response to a change in props, use componentDidUpdate method instead.\nIf you want to re-compute some data only when a prop changes, use a memoization helper instead.\nIf you want to “reset” some state when a prop changes, consider either making a component fully controlled or fully uncontrolled with a key instead.\nParameters \nprops: The next props that the component is about to render with.\nstate: The next state that the component is about to render with.\nReturns \n\nstatic getDerivedStateFromProps return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing.\n\nCaveats \n\nThis method is fired on every render, regardless of the cause. This is different from UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps, which only fires when the parent causes a re-render and not as a result of a local setState.\n\nThis method doesn’t have access to the component instance. If you’d like, you can reuse some code between static getDerivedStateFromProps and the other class methods by extracting pure functions of the component props and state outside the class definition.\n\nNote\n\nImplementing static getDerivedStateFromProps in a class component is equivalent to calling the set function from useState during rendering in a function component.\n\nUsage \nDefining a class component \n\nTo define a React component as a class, extend the built-in Component class and define a render method:\n\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\n\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nReact will call your render method whenever it needs to figure out what to display on the screen. Usually, you will return some JSX from it. Your render method should be a pure function: it should only calculate the JSX.\n\nSimilarly to function components, a class component can receive information by props from its parent component. However, the syntax for reading props is different. For example, if the parent component renders <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />, then you can read the name prop from this.props, like this.props.name:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Greeting name=\"Sara\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Cahal\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Edite\" />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNote that Hooks (functions starting with use, like useState) are not supported inside class components.\n\nPitfall\n\nWe recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.\n\nAdding state to a class component \n\nTo add state to a class, assign an object to a property called state. To update state, call this.setState.\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\nexport default class Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    name: 'Taylor',\n    age: 42,\n  };\n\n  handleNameChange = (e) => {\n    this.setState({\n      name: e.target.value\n    });\n  }\n\n  handleAgeChange = () => {\n    this.setState({\n      age: this.state.age + 1 \n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <input\n          value={this.state.name}\n          onChange={this.handleNameChange}\n        />\n        <button onClick={this.handleAgeChange}>\n          Increment age\n        </button>\n        <p>Hello, {this.state.name}. You are {this.state.age}.</p>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nWe recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.\n\nAdding lifecycle methods to a class component \n\nThere are a few special methods you can define on your class.\n\nIf you define the componentDidMount method, React will call it when your component is added (mounted) to the screen. React will call componentDidUpdate after your component re-renders due to changed props or state. React will call componentWillUnmount after your component has been removed (unmounted) from the screen.\n\nIf you implement componentDidMount, you usually need to implement all three lifecycles to avoid bugs. For example, if componentDidMount reads some state or props, you also have to implement componentDidUpdate to handle their changes, and componentWillUnmount to clean up whatever componentDidMount was doing.\n\nFor example, this ChatRoom component keeps a chat connection synchronized with props and state:\n\nApp.js\nChatRoom.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nexport default class ChatRoom extends Component {\n  state = {\n    serverUrl: 'https://localhost:1234'\n  };\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.setupConnection();\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n    if (\n      this.props.roomId !== prevProps.roomId ||\n      this.state.serverUrl !== prevState.serverUrl\n    ) {\n      this.destroyConnection();\n      this.setupConnection();\n    }\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.destroyConnection();\n  }\n\n  setupConnection() {\n    this.connection = createConnection(\n      this.state.serverUrl,\n      this.props.roomId\n    );\n    this.connection.connect();    \n  }\n\n  destroyConnection() {\n    this.connection.disconnect();\n    this.connection = null;\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <label>\n          Server URL:{' '}\n          <input\n            value={this.state.serverUrl}\n            onChange={e => {\n              this.setState({\n                serverUrl: e.target.value\n              });\n            }}\n          />\n        </label>\n        <h1>Welcome to the {this.props.roomId} room!</h1>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nNote that in development when Strict Mode is on, React will call componentDidMount, immediately call componentWillUnmount, and then call componentDidMount again. This helps you notice if you forgot to implement componentWillUnmount or if its logic doesn’t fully “mirror” what componentDidMount does.\n\nPitfall\n\nWe recommend defining components as functions instead of classes. See how to migrate.\n\nCatching rendering errors with an Error Boundary \n\nBy default, if your application throws an error during rendering, React will remove its UI from the screen. To prevent this, you can wrap a part of your UI into an Error Boundary. An Error Boundary is a special component that lets you display some fallback UI instead of the part that crashed—for example, an error message.\n\nTo implement an Error Boundary component, you need to provide static getDerivedStateFromError which lets you update state in response to an error and display an error message to the user. You can also optionally implement componentDidCatch to add some extra logic, for example, to log the error to an analytics service.\n\nWith captureOwnerStack you can include the Owner Stack during development.\n\nimport * as React from 'react';\n\n\n\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n\n    super(props);\n\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\n\n    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.\n\n    return { hasError: true };\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  componentDidCatch(error, info) {\n\n    logErrorToMyService(\n\n      error,\n\n      // Example \"componentStack\":\n\n      //   in ComponentThatThrows (created by App)\n\n      //   in ErrorBoundary (created by App)\n\n      //   in div (created by App)\n\n      //   in App\n\n      info.componentStack,\n\n      // Warning: `captureOwnerStack` is not available in production.\n\n      React.captureOwnerStack(),\n\n    );\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  render() {\n\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n\n      // You can render any custom fallback UI\n\n      return this.props.fallback;\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    return this.props.children;\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nThen you can wrap a part of your component tree with it:\n\n<ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>Something went wrong</p>}>\n\n  <Profile />\n\n</ErrorBoundary>\n\nIf Profile or its child component throws an error, ErrorBoundary will “catch” that error, display a fallback UI with the error message you’ve provided, and send a production error report to your error reporting service.\n\nYou don’t need to wrap every component into a separate Error Boundary. When you think about the granularity of Error Boundaries, consider where it makes sense to display an error message. For example, in a messaging app, it makes sense to place an Error Boundary around the list of conversations. It also makes sense to place one around every individual message. However, it wouldn’t make sense to place a boundary around every avatar.\n\nNote\n\nThere is currently no way to write an Error Boundary as a function component. However, you don’t have to write the Error Boundary class yourself. For example, you can use react-error-boundary instead.\n\nAlternatives \nMigrating a simple component from a class to a function \n\nTypically, you will define components as functions instead.\n\nFor example, suppose you’re converting this Greeting class component to a function:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Greeting extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Greeting name=\"Sara\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Cahal\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Edite\" />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nDefine a function called Greeting. This is where you will move the body of your render function.\n\nfunction Greeting() {\n\n  // ... move the code from the render method here ...\n\n}\n\nInstead of this.props.name, define the name prop using the destructuring syntax and read it directly:\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n\n}\n\nHere is a complete example:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Greeting name=\"Sara\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Cahal\" />\n      <Greeting name=\"Edite\" />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nMigrating a component with state from a class to a function \n\nSuppose you’re converting this Counter class component to a function:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { Component } from 'react';\n\nexport default class Counter extends Component {\n  state = {\n    name: 'Taylor',\n    age: 42,\n  };\n\n  handleNameChange = (e) => {\n    this.setState({\n      name: e.target.value\n    });\n  }\n\n  handleAgeChange = (e) => {\n    this.setState({\n      age: this.state.age + 1 \n    });\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <input\n          value={this.state.name}\n          onChange={this.handleNameChange}\n        />\n        <button onClick={this.handleAgeChange}>\n          Increment age\n        </button>\n        <p>Hello, {this.state.name}.

In the above example, that’s true: it disconnects the connection that componentDidMount sets up. If such logic is missing, add it first.\n\nNext, verify that your componentDidUpdate method handles changes to any props and state you’re using in componentDidMount. In the above example, componentDidMount calls setupConnection which reads this.state.serverUrl and this.props.roomId. This is why componentDidUpdate checks whether this.state.serverUrl and this.props.roomId have changed, and resets the connection if they did. If your componentDidUpdate logic is missing or doesn’t handle changes to all relevant props and state, fix that first.\n\nIn the above example, the logic inside the lifecycle methods connects the component to a system outside of React (a chat server). To connect a component to an external system, describe this logic as a single Effect:\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n\n    connection.connect();\n\n    return () => {\n\n      connection.disconnect();\n\n    };\n\n  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n}\n\nThis useEffect call is equivalent to the logic in the lifecycle methods above. If your lifecycle methods do multiple unrelated things, split them into multiple independent Effects. Here is a complete example you can play with:\n\nApp.js\nChatRoom.js\nchat.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { createConnection } from './chat.js';\n\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => {\n      connection.disconnect();\n    };\n  }, [roomId, serverUrl]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:{' '}\n        <input\n          value={serverUrl}\n          onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNote\n\nIf your component does not synchronize with any external systems, you might not need an Effect.\n\nMigrating a component with context from a class to a function \n\nIn this example, the Panel and Button class components read context from this.context:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, Component } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nclass Panel extends Component {\n  static contextType = ThemeContext;\n\n  render() {\n    const theme = this.context;\n    const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n    return (\n      <section className={className}>\n        <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>\n        {this.props.children}\n      </section>\n    );    \n  }\n}\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n  static contextType = ThemeContext;\n\n  render() {\n    const theme = this.context;\n    const className = 'button-' + theme;\n    return (\n      <button className={className}>\n        {this.props.children}\n      </button>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n      <Form />\n    </ThemeContext>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nWhen you convert them to function components, replace this.context with useContext calls:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createContext, useContext } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext(null);\n\nfunction Panel({ title, children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'panel-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <section className={className}>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      {children}\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n\nfunction Button({ children }) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const className = 'button-' + theme;\n  return (\n    <button className={className}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Welcome\">\n      <Button>Sign up</Button>\n      <Button>Log in</Button>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext value=\"dark\">\n      <Form />\n    </ThemeContext>\n  )\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPREVIOUS\ncloneElement\nNEXT\ncreateElement"

    "html": "API REFERENCE\nLEGACY REACT APIS\ncreateElement\n\ncreateElement lets you create a React element. It serves as an alternative to writing JSX.\n\nconst element = createElement(type, props, ...children)\nReference\ncreateElement(type, props, ...children)\nUsage\nCreating an element without JSX\nReference \ncreateElement(type, props, ...children) \n\nCall createElement to create a React element with the given type, props, and children.\n\nimport { createElement } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return createElement(\n\n    'h1',\n\n    { className: 'greeting' },\n\n    'Hello'\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nParameters \n\ntype: The type argument must be a valid React component type. For example, it could be a tag name string (such as 'div' or 'span'), or a React component (a function, a class, or a special component like Fragment).\n\nprops: The props argument must either be an object or null. If you pass null, it will be treated the same as an empty object. React will create an element with props matching the props you have passed. Note that ref and key from your props object are special and will not be available as element.props.ref and element.props.key on the returned element. They will be available as element.ref and element.key.\n\noptional ...children: Zero or more child nodes. They can be any React nodes, including React elements, strings, numbers, portals, empty nodes (null, undefined, true, and false), and arrays of React nodes.\n\nReturns \n\ncreateElement returns a React element object with a few properties:\n\ntype: The type you have passed.\nprops: The props you have passed except for ref and key.\nref: The ref you have passed. If missing, null.\nkey: The key you have passed, coerced to a string. If missing, null.\n\nUsually, you’ll return the element from your component or make it a child of another element. Although you may read the element’s properties, it’s best to treat every element as opaque after it’s created, and only render it.\n\nCaveats \n\nYou must treat React elements and their props as immutable and never change their contents after creation. In development, React will freeze the returned element and its props property shallowly to enforce this.\n\nWhen you use JSX, you must start a tag with a capital letter to render your own custom component. In other words, <Something /> is equivalent to createElement(Something), but <something /> (lowercase) is equivalent to createElement('something') (note it’s a string, so it will be treated as a built-in HTML tag).\n\nYou should only pass children as multiple arguments to createElement if they are all statically known, like createElement('h1', {}, child1, child2, child3). If your children are dynamic, pass the entire array as the third argument: createElement('ul', {}, listItems). This ensures that React will warn you about missing keys for any dynamic lists. For static lists this is not necessary because they never reorder.\n\nUsage \nCreating an element without JSX \n\nIf you don’t like JSX or can’t use it in your project, you can use createElement as an alternative.\n\nTo create an element without JSX, call createElement with some type, props, and children:\n\nimport { createElement } from 'react';\n\n\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return createElement(\n\n    'h1',\n\n    { className: 'greeting' },\n\n    'Hello ',\n\n    createElement('i', null, name),\n\n    '. Welcome!'\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe children are optional, and you can pass as many as you need (the example above has three children). This code will display a <h1> header with a greeting. For comparison, here is the same example rewritten with JSX:\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <h1 className=\"greeting\">\n\n      Hello <i>{name}</i>. Welcome!\n\n    </h1>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nTo render your own React component, pass a function like Greeting as the type instead of a string like 'h1':\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return createElement(Greeting, { name: 'Taylor' });\n\n}\n\nWith JSX, it would look like this:\n\nexport default function App() {\n\n  return <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />;\n\n}\n\nHere is a complete example written with createElement:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { createElement } from 'react';\n\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n  return createElement(\n    'h1',\n    { className: 'greeting' },\n    'Hello ',\n    createElement('i', null, name),\n    '. Welcome!'\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return createElement(\n    Greeting,\n    { name: 'Taylor' }\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nAnd here is the same example written using JSX:\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nfunction Greeting({ name }) {\n  return (\n    <h1 className=\"greeting\">\n      Hello <i>{name}</i>. Welcome!\n    </h1>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return <Greeting name=\"Taylor\" />;\n}\n\n\n\nBoth coding styles are fine, so you can use whichever one you prefer for your project. The main benefit of using JSX compared to createElement is that it’s easy to see which closing tag corresponds to which opening tag.\n\nDEEP DIVE\nWhat is a React element, exactly? \nShow Details\nPREVIOUS\nComponent\nNEXT\ncreateRef"

Unlike React components defined as plain functions, a component returned by forwardRef is also able to receive a ref prop.\n\nCaveats \nIn Strict Mode, React will call your render function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities.

Unlike React components defined as plain functions, the component returned by forwardRef is able to take a ref prop.\n\nUsage \nExposing a DOM node to the parent component \n\nBy default, each component’s DOM nodes are private. However, sometimes it’s useful to expose a DOM node to the parent—for example, to allow focusing it. To opt in, wrap your component definition into forwardRef():\n\nimport { forwardRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  const { label, ...otherProps } = props;\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <input {...otherProps} />\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nYou will receive a ref as the second argument after props. Pass it to the DOM node that you want to expose:\n\nimport { forwardRef } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  const { label, ...otherProps } = props;\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <input {...otherProps} ref={ref} />\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nThis lets the parent Form component access the <input> DOM node exposed by MyInput:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    ref.current.focus();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <form>\n\n      <MyInput label=\"Enter your name:\" ref={ref} />\n\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n\n        Edit\n\n      </button>\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThis Form component passes a ref to MyInput. The MyInput component forwards that ref to the <input> browser tag. As a result, the Form component can access that <input> DOM node and call focus() on it.\n\nKeep in mind that exposing a ref to the DOM node inside your component makes it harder to change your component’s internals later. You will typically expose DOM nodes from reusable low-level components like buttons or text inputs, but you won’t do it for application-level components like an avatar or a comment.\n\nExamples of forwarding a ref\n1. Focusing a text input\n2. Playing and pausing a video\nExample 1 of 2: Focusing a text input \n\nClicking the button will focus the input. The Form component defines a ref and passes it to the MyInput component. The MyInput component forwards that ref to the browser <input>. This lets the Form component focus the <input>.\n\nApp.js\nMyInput.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport MyInput from './MyInput.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <MyInput label=\"Enter your name:\" ref={ref} />\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n        Edit\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nNext Example\nForwarding a ref through multiple components \n\nInstead of forwarding a ref to a DOM node, you can forward it to your own component like MyInput:\n\nconst FormField = forwardRef(function FormField(props, ref) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n      <MyInput ref={ref} />\n\n      ...\n\n    </>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nIf that MyInput component forwards a ref to its <input>, a ref to FormField will give you that <input>:\n\nfunction Form() {\n\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  function handleClick() {\n\n    ref.current.focus();\n\n  }\n\n\n\n  return (\n\n    <form>\n\n      <FormField label=\"Enter your name:\" ref={ref} isRequired={true} />\n\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n\n        Edit\n\n      </button>\n\n    </form>\n\n  );\n\n}\n\nThe Form component defines a ref and passes it to FormField. The FormField component forwards that ref to MyInput, which forwards it to a browser <input> DOM node. This is how Form accesses that DOM node.\n\nApp.js\nFormField.js\nMyInput.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport FormField from './FormField.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <FormField label=\"Enter your name:\" ref={ref} isRequired={true} />\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n        Edit\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nExposing an imperative handle instead of a DOM node \n\nInstead of exposing an entire DOM node, you can expose a custom object, called an imperative handle, with a more constrained set of methods. To do this, you’d need to define a separate ref to hold the DOM node:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  // ...\n\n\n\n  return <input {...props} ref={inputRef} />;\n\n});\n\nPass the ref you received to useImperativeHandle and specify the value you want to expose to the ref:\n\nimport { forwardRef, useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';\n\n\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {\n\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n\n\n  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {\n\n    return {\n\n      focus() {\n\n        inputRef.current.focus();\n\n      },\n\n      scrollIntoView() {\n\n        inputRef.current.scrollIntoView();\n\n      },\n\n    };\n\n  }, []);\n\n\n\n  return <input {...props} ref={inputRef} />;\n\n});\n\nIf some component gets a ref to MyInput, it will only receive your { focus, scrollIntoView } object instead of the DOM node. This lets you limit the information you expose about your DOM node to the minimum.\n\nApp.js\nMyInput.js\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { useRef } from 'react';\nimport MyInput from './MyInput.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current.focus();\n    // This won't work because the DOM node isn't exposed:\n    // ref.current.style.opacity = 0.5;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <MyInput placeholder=\"Enter your name\" ref={ref} />\n      <button type=\"button\" onClick={handleClick}>\n        Edit\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\n\nRead more about using imperative handles.\n\nPitfall\n\nDo not overuse refs. You should only use refs for imperative behaviors that you can’t express as props: for example, scrolling to a node, focusing a node, triggering an animation, selecting text, and so on.\n\nIf you can express something as a prop, you should not use a ref. For example, instead of exposing an imperative handle like { open, close } from a Modal component, it is better to take isOpen as a prop like <Modal isOpen={isOpen} />. Effects can help you expose imperative behaviors via props.\n\nTroubleshooting \nMy component is wrapped in forwardRef, but the ref to it is always null \n\nThis usually means that you forgot to actually use the ref that you received.\n\nFor example, this component doesn’t do anything with its ref:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label }, ref) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <input />\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nTo fix it, pass the ref down to a DOM node or another component that can accept a ref:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label }, ref) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <input ref={ref} />\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nThe ref to MyInput could also be null if some of the logic is conditional:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label, showInput }, ref) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      {showInput && <input ref={ref} />}\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\n\nIf showInput is false, then the ref won’t be forwarded to any node, and a ref to MyInput will remain empty. This is particularly easy to miss if the condition is hidden inside another component, like Panel in this example:\n\nconst MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput({ label, showInput }, ref) {\n\n  return (\n\n    <label>\n\n      {label}\n\n      <Panel isExpanded={showInput}>\n\n        <input ref={ref} />\n\n      </Panel>\n\n    </label>\n\n  );\n\n});\nPREVIOUS\ncreateRef\nNEXT\nisValidElement"

However, your component will still re-render if a context that it’s using changes.\n\nIn this example, notice that the Greeting component re-renders whenever name is changed (because that’s one of its props), but not when address is changed (because it’s not passed to Greeting as a prop):\n\nApp.js\nDownload\nReload\nClear\nFork\nimport { PureComponent, useState } from 'react';\n\nclass Greeting extends PureComponent {\n  render() {\n    console.log(\"Greeting was rendered at\", new Date().toLocaleTimeString());\n    return <h3>Hello{this.props.name && ', '}{this.props.name}!</h3>;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function MyApp() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n  const [address, setAddress] = useState('');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Name{': '}\n        <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Address{': '}\n        <input value={address} onChange={e => setAddress(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <Greeting name={name} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\nShow more\nPitfall\n\nWe recommend defining components as functions instead of classes.
